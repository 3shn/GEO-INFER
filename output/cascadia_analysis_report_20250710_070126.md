## Data Sources and Methodology

This analysis integrates data from multiple authoritative sources:

1. **California Sources:**
   - FMMP (Farmland Mapping & Monitoring Program)
   - Land IQ crop mapping
   - ParcelQuest parcel data
   - eWRIMS/CalWATRS water rights

2. **Oregon Sources:**
   - EFU (Exclusive Farm Use) zoning
   - ORMAP parcel system
   - Oregon Water Resources Database

3. **Federal Sources:**
   - USDA NASS CDL (Cropland Data Layer)
   - USDA Economic Research Service
   - USGS National Water Information System

## Technical Framework

The analysis employed H3 hierarchical spatial indexing to enable:
- Unified cross-border analysis
- Efficient spatial operations
- Scalable data processing
- Standardized reporting units

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis results, the following recommendations are provided:

1. **High Potential Areas:** Focus development efforts on hexagons with redevelopment scores > 0.7
2. **Data Quality:** Address data gaps in modules with errors or low confidence scores
3. **Cross-Border Coordination:** Leverage unified H3 framework for California-Oregon planning coordination
4. **Monitoring:** Implement temporal analysis to track changes over time

## Limitations and Future Work

- Some modules operated with limited data availability
- Temporal analysis requires multi-year data integration
- Financial data gaps require specialized acquisition strategies
- Energy infrastructure data needs utility partnerships
