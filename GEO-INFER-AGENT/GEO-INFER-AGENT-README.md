# GEO-INFER-AGENT

## Overview
GEO-INFER-AGENT provides autonomous agent capabilities within the GEO-INFER framework. This module enables the creation, orchestration, and deployment of intelligent autonomous agents that can perform geospatial tasks, make decisions, and interact with the environment without constant human supervision.

## Key Features
- Autonomous geospatial data collection and processing
- Multi-agent coordination for distributed sensing and analysis
- Self-adaptive agents for changing environmental conditions
- Active inference based decision-making systems

## Getting Started
1. Installation
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

2. Configuration
   ```bash
   cp config/example.yaml config/local.yaml
   # Edit local.yaml with your configuration
   ```

3. Running a Simple Agent
   ```bash
   python -m geo_infer_agent.run --agent data_collector --region "POLYGON((...))"
   ```

## Agent Types
GEO-INFER-AGENT supports multiple types of autonomous agents:
- Data Collection Agents for gathering geospatial information
- Analysis Agents for processing and extracting insights
- Monitoring Agents for continuous observation of spatial phenomena
- Decision Agents for autonomous response to changing conditions
- Coordination Agents for managing multi-agent systems
- Learning Agents that improve over time through experience
