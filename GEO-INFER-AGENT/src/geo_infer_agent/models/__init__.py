GEO-INFER-AGENT Models

This package provides different agent architecture and modeling approaches:
- Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agents
- Active Inference based agents
- Reinforcement Learning agents
- Rule-based agents
- Hybrid agent architectures

Each module implements a specific agent architecture that can be used
as a foundation for specialized geospatial agents.
