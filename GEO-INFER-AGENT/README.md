# GEO-INFER-AGENT

**Autonomous Geospatial Agents: Perception, Decision, and Action**

## Overview

GEO-INFER-AGENT is the module dedicated to the **design, implementation, and orchestration of autonomous intelligent agents** within the GEO-INFER framework. These agents are software entities capable of perceiving their (geospatial) environment, making decisions, and taking actions to achieve specific goals without constant human intervention. This module provides the foundational components for building agents that can perform tasks such as autonomous data collection, real-time environmental monitoring, distributed sensing, adaptive resource management, and even coordinating complex multi-agent systems. By leveraging principles from Active Inference (via GEO-INFER-ACT), Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) models, Reinforcement Learning (RL), and other AI paradigms, GEO-INFER-AGENT aims to enable sophisticated, adaptive, and robust autonomous operations in dynamic geospatial contexts.

## Core Objectives

-   **Autonomy:** Enable agents to perform complex geospatial tasks with minimal human supervision.
-   **Adaptivity:** Equip agents to learn from experience and adapt their behavior to changing environmental conditions or new information.
-   **Intelligence:** Incorporate reasoning, planning, and decision-making capabilities based on various AI paradigms.
-   **Coordination:** Facilitate effective communication and collaboration between multiple agents to solve distributed problems.
-   **Situatedness & Embodiment (Conceptual):** Design agents that are aware of and can interact meaningfully with their geospatial environment, whether virtual (in simulations) or physical (via robotics/IoT integrations).
-   **Goal-Orientation:** Enable agents to pursue predefined or dynamically generated goals effectively.
-   **Ethical Operation:** Promote the development of agents that operate transparently, accountably, and in alignment with human values (see Ethical Considerations).

## Key Features

-   **Diverse Agent Architectures:** Support for multiple agent control architectures including:
    -   **Active Inference Agents (integrating GEO-INFER-ACT):** Agents that act to minimize free energy, enabling perception, learning, and planning under uncertainty.
    -   **Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) Agents:** Goal-driven agents with explicit representations of beliefs, desires (goals), and intentions (plans).
    -   **Reinforcement Learning (RL) Agents (integrating GEO-INFER-AI):** Agents that learn optimal policies through trial-and-error interaction with an environment.
    -   **Rule-Based & Expert System Agents:** Agents operating based on predefined sets of rules or knowledge bases.
    -   **Hybrid Architectures:** Combining strengths from different approaches.
-   **Autonomous Geospatial Data Collection & Processing:** Agents capable of navigating to specified areas (virtual or physical), collecting data (e.g., imagery, sensor readings, social media), and performing initial processing.
-   **Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) Coordination:** Frameworks for communication (e.g., FIPA-ACL like message passing, shared blackboards, stigmergy) and coordination (e.g., contract nets, auctions, distributed task allocation) among multiple agents.
-   **Self-Adaptive & Learning Capabilities:** Agents that can monitor their own performance, learn from new data or feedback, and adapt their strategies or internal models over time.
-   **Planning & Task Execution Engine:** Components for agents to generate plans to achieve goals and reliably execute those plans, including error handling and replanning.
-   **Perception & World Modeling:** Mechanisms for agents to perceive their environment (using data from GEO-INFER-DATA, GEO-INFER-SPACE, GEO-INFER-TIME), build internal models (world representations), and update these models based on new observations.
-   **Agent Orchestration & Deployment Tools:** Utilities for configuring, launching, monitoring, and managing the lifecycle of individual agents and multi-agent systems.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Libraries specific to chosen agent architectures (e.g., `spade` for some BDI, `pymdp` for Active Inference, RL libraries like `stable-baselines3` or `Ray RLlib`).
- Potentially a message queue system (e.g., RabbitMQ, Redis Streams) for inter-agent communication in distributed MAS.

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the GEO-INFER repository if you haven't already
# git clone https://github.com/activeinference/GEO-INFER.git
# cd GEO-INFER/GEO-INFER-AGENT

pip install -e .
# or poetry install if pyproject.toml is configured
```

### Configuration
Agent behaviors, initial beliefs, goals, planning operators, and communication settings are often defined in YAML or JSON configuration files in `config/`, or directly within agent definition scripts.
```bash
# cp config/example_actinf_agent.yaml config/my_actinf_config.yaml
# # Edit my_actinf_config.yaml with specific parameters for your Active Inference agent
```

### Running a Simple Agent (Example)
```bash
# Example: Running a data collection agent defined in a script
python examples/run_data_collector_agent.py --config config/data_collector_params.yaml --area "POLYGON((...))"

# Example: Starting a BDI agent platform (if applicable)
# python -m geo_infer_agent.platforms.bdi_platform --config config/bdi_setup.yaml
```

## Agent Types Supported

GEO-INFER-AGENT aims to support a variety of specialized autonomous agents:

-   **Data Collection Agents:** Autonomously navigate to areas of interest (virtual or physical) to gather specific geospatial information (e.g., satellite imagery, sensor readings, social media posts, VGI).
-   **Analysis Agents:** Process collected or streamed geospatial data to extract insights, detect patterns, or identify anomalies (e.g., change detection agent, feature extraction agent).
-   **Monitoring Agents:** Continuously observe specific spatial phenomena or areas, triggering alerts or actions when predefined conditions are met (e.g., deforestation monitor, flood risk monitor).
-   **Decision & Control Agents:** Make autonomous decisions and take actions to manage or influence geospatial systems (e.g., adaptive irrigation controller, dynamic traffic management agent).
-   **Coordination & Broker Agents:** Facilitate communication and task allocation within multi-agent systems, acting as mediators or brokers.
-   **Learning Agents:** Explicitly designed to improve their performance over time through experience, feedback, or interaction with other agents or humans.
-   **Simulation Agents (for GEO-INFER-SIM):** Agents designed to operate within simulated environments, often used to test hypotheses or explore complex system dynamics before real-world deployment.

## Agent Capabilities

Key capabilities provided or integrated by the module include:

-   **Geospatial Perception:** Interpreting sensor data, map layers, and other geospatial information to build an understanding of the environment.
-   **Spatial & Temporal Reasoning:** Making inferences about spatial relationships, temporal patterns, and dynamic processes.
-   **Goal-Directed Planning & Execution:** Generating sequences of actions to achieve objectives, monitoring execution, and replanning if necessary.
-   **Adaptive Behavior:** Modifying actions or strategies in response to changes in the environment or new information.
-   **Inter-Agent Communication & Coordination:** Exchanging messages, sharing knowledge, and coordinating actions with other agents (human or artificial).
-   **Learning from Experience:** Utilizing machine learning (e.g., RL, supervised learning from GEO-INFER-AI) or other adaptive mechanisms (e.g., Bayesian updating in Active Inference) to improve behavior.
-   **Navigation & Pathfinding:** (For mobile agents) Planning and executing routes through geospatial environments.

## Agent Architectures Supported

The module facilitates the implementation of various established agent architectures:

-   **Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI):** Agents with explicit mentalistic notions. Beliefs represent the agent's knowledge about the world, Desires represent its goals, and Intentions represent its committed plans of action.
-   **Active Inference (ActInf):** Agents driven by the imperative to minimize variational free energy (or maximize model evidence). This provides a first-principles account of perception, learning, and decision-making under uncertainty (strong ties to GEO-INFER-ACT).
-   **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** Agents learn optimal policies by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or punishments. Often involves training deep neural networks (ties to GEO-INFER-AI).
-   **Rule-Based / Expert Systems:** Agents operate based on a predefined set of IF-THEN rules or a knowledge base curated by domain experts.
-   **Hybrid Architectures:** Combining elements from different architectures to leverage their respective strengths (e.g., an RL agent might use a BDI-style planner for high-level goal setting).

## Integration with Other Modules

GEO-INFER-AGENT is designed to work in concert with many other GEO-INFER modules:

-   **GEO-INFER-ACT:** Provides the core mathematical and conceptual framework for agents based on Active Inference.
-   **GEO-INFER-AI:** Offers machine learning models and algorithms that can be embedded within agents for perception, learning, and decision-making (e.g., computer vision for image analysis, RL for policy learning).
-   **GEO-INFER-SPACE & GEO-INFER-TIME:** Provide the environmental context (spatial data, geometries, temporal dynamics) that agents perceive, reason about, and act within.
-   **GEO-INFER-DATA:** Serves as the source for observational data agents use for perception and learning, and as a repository for data collected by agents.
-   **GEO-INFER-SIM:** Agents can be deployed and tested within simulation environments created by SIM, allowing for rapid prototyping and evaluation before real-world application.
-   **GEO-INFER-API:** Agents may expose their own APIs for control and monitoring, or interact with other GEO-INFER modules via their APIs.
-   **GEO-INFER-NORMS & GEO-INFER-CIV:** Agents can be designed to operate according to norms or policies defined in NORMS, or interact with community platforms from CIV (e.g., a data collection agent responding to citizen requests).
-   **GEO-INFER-OPS:** May be used for deploying, monitoring, and managing the lifecycle of agent-based systems, especially in distributed settings.

## Application Areas

-   **Automated Environmental Monitoring:** Deploying agents to track changes in land cover, water quality, air pollution, or biodiversity.

-   **Human Oversight & Intervention:** Ensuring that human operators can monitor agent activities, intervene if necessary, and override autonomous decisions.
-   **Privacy-Preserving Data Handling:** Agents must adhere to privacy principles when collecting, processing, and storing geospatial data, especially personal or sensitive information.
-   **Fairness & Non-Discrimination:** Ensuring that agent behaviors and decisions do not lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes, particularly in resource allocation or access to services.
-   **Accountability & Responsibility:** Establishing clear lines of responsibility for agent actions and their consequences.
-   **Security & Robustness:** Designing agents that are resilient to adversarial attacks and operate reliably under uncertain conditions.
-   **Impact Assessment & Value Alignment:** Tools and frameworks for assessing the potential societal and environmental impacts of agent deployments and ensuring they align with human values and ethical guidelines (potentially integrating with GEO-INFER-NORMS).
