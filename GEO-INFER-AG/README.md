## Getting Started
1. Installation
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

2. Configuration
   ```bash
   cp config/example.yaml config/local.yaml
   # Edit local.yaml with your configuration
   ```

3. Running an Agricultural Analysis
   ```python
   from geo_infer_ag.models import CropYieldModel
   from geo_infer_ag.core import AgriculturalAnalysis
   
   # Define agricultural data and model
   model = CropYieldModel(crop_type='corn')
   
   # Perform agricultural analysis
   analysis = AgriculturalAnalysis(model=model)
   results = analysis.run(field_data=field_gdf, weather_data=weather_df)
   
   # Visualize agricultural indicators
   results.plot_spatial_distribution('predicted_yield')
   ```
