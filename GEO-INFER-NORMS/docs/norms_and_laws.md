# Norms and Laws in GEO-INFER-NORMS

This document provides an overview of the Norms and Laws components in the GEO-INFER-NORMS module, explaining key concepts, classes, and usage patterns for legal tech, zoning analysis, and related geospatial applications.

## 1. Overview

The GEO-INFER-NORMS module provides a comprehensive framework for modeling, analyzing, and tracking legal norms, regulations, and compliance in geospatial contexts. It integrates probabilistic modeling with deterministic legal rules to support various applications including:

- **Legal and Regulatory Analysis**: Modeling jurisdictions, legal frameworks, and their spatial relationships
- **Zoning Analysis**: Analyzing land use regulations, zoning compatibility, and zoning changes
- **Compliance Tracking**: Monitoring compliance with regulations across entities and jurisdictions
- **Policy Impact Assessment**: Evaluating the impacts of policies and regulatory changes
- **Normative Inference**: Using inferential techniques to reason about norms and their implications

## 2. Core Concepts

### 2.1 Legal Frameworks and Jurisdictions

#### Jurisdictions

Jurisdictions are geographical areas with legal authority to create and enforce regulations. The module represents jurisdictions hierarchically, with parent-child relationships (e.g., country → state → county → city). Each jurisdiction has:

- A spatial boundary (geometry)
- A level (federal, state, county, city, etc.)
- Relationships to parent/child jurisdictions

#### Legal Frameworks

Legal frameworks are collections of regulations and jurisdictions that work together as a cohesive system. They provide mechanisms to:

- Find regulations applicable to a specific jurisdiction
- Determine which regulations apply to a specific geographic point
- Analyze overlapping jurisdictional authorities

### 2.2 Regulations and Compliance

#### Regulations

Regulations are legal rules that entities must comply with. Each regulation has:

- An issuing authority
- Effective dates
- Applicable jurisdictions
- Parent-child relationships with other regulations

#### Compliance Status

The module tracks compliance of entities with regulations through:

- Binary compliance status (compliant/non-compliant)
- Continuous compliance levels (0.0 to 1.0)
- Detailed metrics and evidence for compliance evaluation
- Temporal tracking of compliance changes

### 2.3 Zoning and Land Use

#### Zoning Codes and Districts

Zoning codes define allowed land uses and development standards. Zoning districts are geographic areas assigned specific zoning codes. The module supports:

- Multiple zoning code types (residential, commercial, industrial, etc.)
- Overlay zoning
- Compatibility analysis between different zoning types
- Evaluation of zoning changes

#### Land Use Classification

Land use refers to the actual use of land, which may or may not conform to zoning regulations. The module provides:

- Land use classification based on various features
- Analysis of land use patterns and compatibility
- Comparison of actual land use to zoning regulations

### 2.4 Policies and Their Implementation

#### Policies

Policies are formal statements of intention that guide decision-making and may lead to regulations. The module models:

- Policy objectives and goals
- Relationships between policies and regulations
- Spatial extents of policy applicability

#### Policy Implementation

Policy implementation tracks how policies are put into practice, including:

- Implementation actions and timelines
- Resources allocated to implementation
- Outcomes and metrics for success

## 3. Key Components and Classes

### 3.1 Legal Framework Components

#### `LegalFramework` Class

```python
from geo_infer_norms.core.legal_frameworks import LegalFramework
from geo_infer_norms.models.legal_entity import Jurisdiction
from geo_infer_norms.models.regulation import Regulation

# Create a legal framework
framework = LegalFramework(
    name="Environmental Protection Framework",
    description="A framework for environmental regulations",
    jurisdictions=[...],  # List of Jurisdiction objects
    regulations=[...]     # List of Regulation objects
)

# Get regulations applicable to a specific point
point = Point(longitude, latitude)
applicable_regs = framework.get_regulations_by_point(point)
```

#### `JurisdictionHandler` Class

```python
from geo_infer_norms.core.legal_frameworks import JurisdictionHandler

# Create a jurisdiction handler
handler = JurisdictionHandler(jurisdictions=[...])

# Get jurisdictional hierarchy
hierarchy = handler.get_jurisdiction_hierarchy("city_1")

# Find jurisdictions at a specific level
states = handler.find_jurisdictions_at_level("state")

# Find jurisdictions that overlap with a geometry
overlapping = handler.get_overlapping_jurisdictions(polygon)
```

### 3.2 Zoning Analysis Components

#### `ZoningAnalyzer` Class

```python
from geo_infer_norms.core.zoning_analysis import ZoningAnalyzer
from geo_infer_norms.models.zoning import ZoningCode, ZoningDistrict

# Create a zoning analyzer
analyzer = ZoningAnalyzer(
    zoning_districts=[...],  # List of ZoningDistrict objects
    zoning_codes=[...]       # List of ZoningCode objects
)

# Analyze zoning boundaries for conflicts
conflicts = analyzer.analyze_zoning_boundaries()

# Evaluate a zoning change
evaluation = analyzer.evaluate_zoning_change("district_1", "new_code")

# Visualize zoning districts
fig = analyzer.visualize_zoning()
```

#### `LandUseClassifier` Class

```python
from geo_infer_norms.core.zoning_analysis import LandUseClassifier
import geopandas as gpd

# Create a land use classifier
classifier = LandUseClassifier(land_use_types=[...])

# Classify land use based on features
parcels_gdf = gpd.GeoDataFrame(...)
classified = classifier.classify_land_use(
    parcels_gdf,
    feature_columns=['building_count', 'population_density', ...]
)

# Analyze land use patterns
pattern_analysis = classifier.analyze_land_use_pattern(classified_gdf)

# Visualize land use classification
fig = classifier.visualize_land_use(classified_gdf)
```

### 3.3 Compliance Tracking Components

#### `ComplianceTracker` Class

```python
from geo_infer_norms.core.compliance_tracking import ComplianceTracker
from geo_infer_norms.models.compliance_status import ComplianceStatus, ComplianceMetric

# Create a compliance tracker
tracker = ComplianceTracker(
    name="Environmental Compliance Tracker",
    compliance_statuses=[...],  # List of ComplianceStatus objects
    compliance_metrics=[...]    # List of ComplianceMetric objects
)

# Get compliance status for an entity
entity_compliance = tracker.get_entity_compliance("entity_1")

# Get compliance status for a regulation
regulation_compliance = tracker.get_regulation_compliance("reg_1")

# Evaluate compliance of an entity with a regulation
status = tracker.evaluate_compliance(entity, regulation, evaluation_data)

# Export compliance data for visualization
compliance_gdf = tracker.export_compliance_to_geodataframe(entities)
```

#### `ComplianceReport` Class

```python
from geo_infer_norms.core.compliance_tracking import ComplianceReport

# Create a compliance report
report = ComplianceReport(
    compliance_tracker=tracker,
    title="Annual Compliance Report",
    description="Annual compliance report for environmental regulations"
)

# Generate summary report
summary = report.generate_summary_report()

# Generate detailed entity report
entity_report = report.generate_entity_report("entity_1")

# Export report to HTML
report.export_report_to_html("report.html")
```

## 4. Application Examples

### 4.1 Zoning Analysis and Land Use Planning

The GEO-INFER-NORMS module can be used to analyze zoning patterns, evaluate zoning changes, and assess land use compatibility:

```python
# Example: Evaluating a proposed zoning change
from geo_infer_norms.core.zoning_analysis import ZoningAnalyzer

# Initialize analyzer with current zoning
analyzer = ZoningAnalyzer(zoning_districts=current_districts, zoning_codes=codes)

# Analyze current zoning boundaries
current_analysis = analyzer.analyze_zoning_boundaries()
print(f"Current compatibility: {current_analysis['average_compatibility']}")
print(f"Current conflicts: {len(current_analysis['potential_conflicts'])}")

# Evaluate changing an industrial district to mixed use
evaluation = analyzer.evaluate_zoning_change("industrial_district_1", "MU-1")
print(f"Compatibility change: {evaluation['compatibility_change']}")

# Visualize the potential change
fig = analyzer.visualize_zoning(highlight_district="industrial_district_1")
```

### 4.2 Legal Compliance Monitoring

The module can track compliance with regulations across jurisdictions and visualize compliance patterns:

```python
# Example: Tracking environmental compliance across a region
from geo_infer_norms.core.compliance_tracking import ComplianceTracker
import geopandas as gpd

# Initialize tracker with compliance data
tracker = ComplianceTracker(name="Environmental Compliance Tracker")

# Evaluate compliance for entities
for entity in entities:
    tracker.evaluate_compliance(
        entity,
        water_quality_regulation,
        {'pollutant_level': entity.measurements['pollutant_level']}
    )

# Export compliance data for visualization
compliance_gdf = tracker.export_compliance_to_geodataframe(entities)

# Visualize compliance
fig = tracker.visualize_compliance(compliance_gdf, column='compliance_level')

# Generate compliance report
report = ComplianceReport(tracker)
summary = report.generate_summary_report()
print(f"Overall compliance rate: {summary['compliance_percentage']}%")
```

### 4.3 Jurisdictional Analysis

The module can analyze overlapping jurisdictions and determine which regulations apply to specific locations:

```python
# Example: Finding applicable regulations at a specific location
from geo_infer_norms.core.legal_frameworks import LegalFramework
from shapely.geometry import Point

# Initialize framework with jurisdictions and regulations
framework = LegalFramework(
    name="Regulatory Framework",
    jurisdictions=jurisdictions,
    regulations=regulations
)

# Find regulations at a specific point
point = Point(-74.0060, 40.7128)  # New York City coordinates
applicable_regs = framework.get_regulations_by_point(point)

print(f"Applicable regulations at location: {len(applicable_regs)}")
for reg in applicable_regs:
    print(f"- {reg.name} ({reg.regulation_type})")
```

## 5. Advanced Usage

### 5.1 Integrating with Other GEO-INFER Modules

GEO-INFER-NORMS is designed to work seamlessly with other GEO-INFER modules:

- **GEO-INFER-SPACE**: For advanced spatial operations and indexing
- **GEO-INFER-TIME**: For temporal analysis of changing regulations
- **GEO-INFER-SIM**: For simulating the impacts of policy changes
- **GEO-INFER-RISK**: For assessing regulatory risk and compliance impacts

Example integration with GEO-INFER-SPACE:

```python
from geo_infer_norms.core.legal_frameworks import LegalFramework
from geo_infer_space.core import SpatialIndex

# Create a spatial index for jurisdictions
spatial_index = SpatialIndex(index_type="h3")
for jurisdiction in jurisdictions:
    spatial_index.add_geometry(jurisdiction.id, jurisdiction.geometry)

# Use the spatial index for faster spatial queries
point = Point(longitude, latitude)
candidate_jurisdictions = spatial_index.query_point(point)

# Then process with the legal framework
framework = LegalFramework(jurisdictions=jurisdictions, regulations=regulations)
detailed_results = framework.get_regulations_by_jurisdiction(candidate_jurisdictions[0])
```

### 5.2 Probabilistic Normative Reasoning

The module supports probabilistic reasoning about norms and regulations:

```python
from geo_infer_norms.core.normative_inference import NormativeInference

# Create a normative inference engine
inference = NormativeInference()

# Add observations about entity behavior
inference.add_observation(entity_id="entity_1", behavior="emission_level", value=2.5)

# Add norms with probabilities
inference.add_norm(
    name="Clean Air Standard",
    condition=lambda x: x['emission_level'] < 3.0,
    probability=0.9
)

# Infer norm compliance
compliance_probability = inference.infer_compliance("entity_1")
print(f"Probability of compliance: {compliance_probability}")
```

### 5.3 Custom Extensions

The module is designed to be extensible for domain-specific applications:

```python
# Example: Extending the ComplianceMetric class for a domain-specific metric
from geo_infer_norms.models.compliance_status import ComplianceMetric

class WaterQualityMetric(ComplianceMetric):
    def __init__(self, regulation_id, pollutant_name, threshold):
        super().__init__(
            id=f"water_quality_{pollutant_name}",
            name=f"{pollutant_name} Water Quality Standard",
            description=f"Compliance metric for {pollutant_name} levels in water",
            regulation_id=regulation_id,
            evaluation_type="threshold",
            primary_field=f"{pollutant_name}_level",
            threshold_value=threshold,
            comparison="less_than"
        )
        self.pollutant_name = pollutant_name
        
    def evaluate(self, data):
        # Custom evaluation logic
        pollutant_level = data.get(f"{self.pollutant_name}_level")
        if pollutant_level is None:
            return False, 0.0, f"No data for {self.pollutant_name}"
            
        is_compliant = pollutant_level < self.threshold_value
        if is_compliant:
            compliance_level = 1.0
        else:
            # Calculate compliance level based on how far over threshold
            excess = pollutant_level / self.threshold_value
            compliance_level = max(0, 1 - (excess - 1))
            
        return is_compliant, compliance_level, f"{self.pollutant_name} level: {pollutant_level}"
```

## 6. Best Practices

### 6.1 Data Management

- **Persistent Storage**: For production applications, store jurisdiction, regulation, and compliance data in a database with spatial capabilities (e.g., PostGIS).
- **Versioning**: Maintain versioning for regulations and policies to track changes over time.
- **Data Validation**: Validate geometries and ensure topological correctness of jurisdictional boundaries.

### 6.2 Performance Optimization

- **Spatial Indexing**: Use spatial indexes for efficient queries on large jurisdictional datasets.
- **Caching**: Cache frequent jurisdiction and regulation lookups to improve performance.
- **Hierarchical Processing**: Leverage the hierarchical nature of jurisdictions to optimize queries (e.g., narrow down from country to state to county).

### 6.3 Visualization and Reporting

- **Interactive Maps**: Use interactive maps to visualize jurisdictions, zoning, and compliance.
- **Temporal Visualization**: Show changes in regulations and compliance over time.
- **Customized Reports**: Generate customized reports for different stakeholders (e.g., regulators, compliance officers, planners).
