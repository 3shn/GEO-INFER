## Temporal Analysis Capabilities (Expanded)

GEO-INFER-TIME provides a rich set of tools for a deep understanding of temporal patterns:

-   **Time Series Decomposition**: Classical (moving averages), STL decomposition, X-13ARIMA-SEATS for robust trend, seasonal, and residual component extraction.
-   **Autocorrelation & Cross-Correlation Analysis**: ACF, PACF plots for seasonality identification and model order selection; cross-correlation for identifying lagged relationships between multiple time series.
-   **Stationarity Testing & Transformation**: Augmented Dickey-Fuller, KPSS tests for stationarity; differencing, log transforms to achieve stationarity.
-   **Change Point & Structural Break Detection**: Bayesian methods, Pruned Exact Linear Time (PELT), CUSUM charts.
-   **Seasonal Pattern Analysis & Adjustment**: Sophisticated seasonal decomposition, seasonal dummy variables, Fourier analysis for complex seasonalities.
-   **Temporal Clustering & Classification**: Grouping time series based on shape (e.g., DTW-based clustering) or features; classifying time series into predefined categories.
-   **Anomaly & Outlier Detection**: Statistical methods (e.g., Z-score, IQR), distance-based methods (e.g., k-NN), density-based methods (e.g., LOF), and model-based approaches (e.g., residuals from forecasts).

## Data Handling (Expanded)

The module is architected to handle the diverse and often challenging characteristics of temporal data in geospatial contexts:

-   **Regular & Irregular Time Series**: Robust handling of both fixed-interval and variable-interval data, including methods for converting between them.
-   **Event-Based & Point Process Data**: Timestamps marking specific occurrences, and tools for analyzing rates, inter-event times, and clustering of events (e.g., Hawkes processes for self-exciting phenomena).

-   **Handling of Censored & Truncated Data**: Methods to deal with time series where observations are incomplete due to censoring or truncation.

## Integration with Other Modules

GEO-INFER-TIME serves as a critical temporal engine for the GEO-INFER ecosystem:

-   **GEO-INFER-SPACE**: Indispensable for spatio-temporal analysis. TIME provides the temporal dimension, models, and analytics for spatial data managed by SPACE. This enables tracking changes in spatial patterns over time, spatio-temporal kriging/interpolation, modeling object movement, and analyzing diffusion or spreading phenomena (e.g., wildfires, disease outbreaks).
-   **GEO-INFER-DATA**: TIME relies on DATA for accessing, storing, and managing the persistence of raw and processed time-series datasets. DATA may handle versioning, archival, and metadata for temporal data assets, including STAC catalogs.
-   **GEO-INFER-ACT & GEO-INFER-AGENT**: Dynamic active inference models (ACT) and agent-based models (AGENT) require robust temporal representations of the environment and agent states/histories. TIME provides tools to model these temporal dynamics, generate forecasts for agent planning, and analyze agent interaction patterns over time.
-   **GEO-INFER-AI & GEO-INFER-ML**: Many AI/ML techniques are inherently temporal (e.g., LSTMs, TCNs for forecasting, Reinforcement Learning with temporal state spaces). TIME provides preprocessed temporal data, feature engineering, and specialized temporal cross-validation strategies for these AI/ML models.
-   **GEO-INFER-SIM**: Simulations intrinsically evolve over time. TIME can be used to analyze simulation outputs (time series of model variables), compare simulated trajectories with real-world data for model validation, or provide dynamic temporal drivers (e.g., historical climate scenarios) for simulations.
-   **GEO-INFER-APP & GEO-INFER-VIS**: Applications frequently need to display time-varying data, interactive dashboards with temporal trends, real-time updates, and animations. TIME provides the backend services, query capabilities, and aggregated data to power these frontend components and visualizations.
-   **GEO-INFER-ECON**: Economic models often involve time-series analysis of indicators, asset prices, or policy impacts. TIME can provide econometric time-series tools for these analyses.
-   **GEO-INFER-RISK**: Assessing risks often involves understanding temporal probabilities of events (e.g., flood recurrence intervals) and forecasting potential future hazards, for which TIME provides essential tools.

## Use Cases (Expanded Examples)

-   **Climate Change Impact Analysis**: Analyzing long-term trends in temperature, precipitation, sea level rise from instrumental and proxy records; forecasting future climate scenarios and their impacts on ecosystems and infrastructure.
-   **Urban Dynamics & Smart Cities**: Analyzing real-time traffic flow for congestion prediction and signal optimization; modeling urban growth patterns over decades using satellite imagery; understanding energy consumption dynamics.
-   **Precision Agriculture & Food Security**: Monitoring crop growth stages and health using time series of satellite-derived vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI); forecasting yields; optimizing irrigation based on temporal soil moisture data.
-   **Natural Hazard Monitoring & Early Warning**: Real-time processing of seismic sensor data for earthquake detection; analyzing river gauge data for flood forecasting; tracking wildfire spread using thermal imagery time series.
-   **Epidemiology & Public Health Surveillance**: Tracking the spatio-temporal spread of infectious diseases; forecasting outbreaks; analyzing the impact of interventions on disease incidence over time.
-   **Financial Geointelligence**: Analyzing time series of economic activity derived from satellite imagery (e.g., nighttime lights, shipping activity) for market insights.
-   **Ecological Research**: Tracking animal movement patterns from GPS collar data; analyzing long-term changes in biodiversity from survey data; modeling predator-prey dynamics over time.
