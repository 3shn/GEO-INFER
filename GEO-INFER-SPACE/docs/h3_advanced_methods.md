# H3 Advanced Methods Documentation

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive documentation for the advanced H3 methods implemented in GEO-INFER-SPACE, based on real-world applications and best practices from the Analytics Vidhya H3 guide and other industry sources.

## Machine Learning Integration

### H3MLFeatureEngine

The `H3MLFeatureEngine` class provides sophisticated feature engineering capabilities for machine learning applications using H3 hexagonal grids.

#### Key Features

- **Spatial Feature Engineering**: Converts H3 grids into ML-ready feature sets
- **Neighbor-based Features**: Extracts features from surrounding hexagons
- **Temporal Features**: Handles time-series data with cyclical encoding
- **Demand Forecasting**: Specialized features for transportation demand prediction

#### Basic Usage

```python
from geo_infer_space.h3 import H3Grid, H3Cell, H3MLFeatureEngine

# Create grid with demand data
grid = H3Grid()
cell = H3Cell.from_coordinates(37.7749, -122.4194, 9)
cell.properties.update({
    'demand': 150,
    'population': 1000,
    'timestamp': '2023-06-15T14:30:00'
})
grid.add_cell(cell)

# Generate ML features
engine = H3MLFeatureEngine(grid)
features = engine.create_spatial_features('demand', neighbor_rings=2)

print(f"Generated {len(features['features'])} feature sets")
print(f"Features per cell: {len(features['feature_names'])}")
```

#### Demand Forecasting Features

Specialized for ride-sharing and transportation demand prediction:

```python
# Create demand forecasting features
demand_features = engine.create_demand_forecasting_features('ride_requests')

# Features include:
# - Spatial: cell area, coordinates, neighbor statistics
# - Temporal: hour, day of week, business hours, cyclical encoding
# - Demand-specific: density, gradients, supply-demand balance
# - Economic: utilization rates, scarcity indicators
```

#### Feature Categories

1. **Spatial Features**
   - Cell coordinates and area
   - Distance from equator/prime meridian
   - Neighbor statistics (mean, std, max, min)
   - Spatial density measures

2. **Temporal Features**
   - Hour, day of week, month, quarter
   - Business hours, weekend, rush hour indicators
   - Cyclical encoding (sin/cos transforms)

3. **Demand-Specific Features**
   - Demand density per unit area
   - Spatial demand gradients
   - Supply-demand balance ratios
   - Utilization and scarcity indicators

### Mathematical Foundations

#### Spatial Autocorrelation
The engine calculates spatial relationships using Moran's I statistic:

```
I = (n/W) * Σᵢⱼ wᵢⱼ(xᵢ - x̄)(xⱼ - x̄) / Σᵢ(xᵢ - x̄)²
```

Where:
- `n` = number of spatial units
- `W` = sum of all spatial weights
- `wᵢⱼ` = spatial weight between units i and j
- `xᵢ, xⱼ` = attribute values at units i and j
- `x̄` = mean of attribute values

#### Cyclical Encoding
Temporal features use cyclical encoding to preserve periodicity:

```python
hour_sin = sin(2π * hour / 24)
hour_cos = cos(2π * hour / 24)
```

This ensures that hour 23 and hour 0 are recognized as adjacent.

## Disaster Response and Environmental Monitoring

### H3DisasterResponse

The `H3DisasterResponse` class provides methods for emergency management, evacuation planning, and environmental monitoring.

#### Evacuation Zone Analysis

```python
from geo_infer_space.h3 import H3DisasterResponse

# Create disaster response analyzer
analyzer = H3DisasterResponse(grid)

# Analyze evacuation zones
evacuation_analysis = analyzer.analyze_evacuation_zones(
    hazard_column='flood_risk',
    population_column='population',
    evacuation_radius_km=3.0
)

print(f"High-risk zones: {len(evacuation_analysis['high_risk_zones'])}")
print(f"Affected population: {evacuation_analysis['total_affected_population']:,}")
```

#### Environmental Change Monitoring

```python
# Monitor environmental changes
changes = analyzer.monitor_environmental_changes(
    baseline_column='baseline_temperature',
    current_column='current_temperature',
    change_threshold=0.2
)

print(f"Significant changes: {len(changes['significant_changes'])}")
print(f"Change clusters: {len(changes['change_clusters'])}")
```

#### Key Capabilities

1. **Risk Assessment**
   - Hazard level classification
   - Population vulnerability analysis
   - Infrastructure impact assessment

2. **Evacuation Planning**
   - Evacuation zone calculation
   - Population capacity estimation
   - Resource requirement analysis

3. **Environmental Monitoring**
   - Change detection algorithms
   - Spatial clustering of changes
   - Statistical trend analysis

### Evacuation Zone Calculation

The system estimates evacuation zones using H3's hierarchical structure:

```python
# Estimate rings needed for evacuation radius
edge_length_km = get_edge_length_for_resolution(resolution)
estimated_rings = max(1, int(evacuation_radius_km / edge_length_km))

# Get cells within evacuation radius
evacuation_cells = h3.grid_disk(hazard_cell, estimated_rings)
```

## Performance Optimization

### H3PerformanceOptimizer

The `H3PerformanceOptimizer` class provides benchmarking and optimization recommendations for large-scale H3 applications.

#### Benchmarking H3 Operations

```python
from geo_infer_space.h3 import H3PerformanceOptimizer

optimizer = H3PerformanceOptimizer()

# Benchmark operations
test_coords = [(37.7749, -122.4194), (40.7128, -74.0060)]
results = optimizer.benchmark_h3_operations(test_coords, resolutions=[8, 9, 10])

print(f"Coordinate conversion: {results['benchmark_results']['coordinate_conversion']['operations_per_second']:.0f} ops/sec")
```

#### Resolution Optimization

```python
# Get resolution recommendations
recommendation = optimizer.optimize_grid_resolution(
    area_km2=100.0,
    analysis_type='ml',
    target_cells=5000
)

print(f"Recommended resolution: {recommendation['recommended_resolution']}")
print(f"Estimated cells: {recommendation['estimated_cells']:,}")
```

#### Optimization Guidelines

1. **Resolution Selection**
   - **ML Applications**: Resolutions 7-10 for good feature granularity
   - **Visualization**: Resolutions 6-8 for performance
   - **Routing**: Resolutions 9-12 for accuracy
   - **General Analysis**: Resolutions 6-10 for balance

2. **Performance Thresholds**
   - **Good Performance**: ≤50,000 cells
   - **Moderate Performance**: 50,000-200,000 cells
   - **Consider Optimization**: >200,000 cells

3. **Memory Management**
   - **Acceptable**: <100 MB memory usage
   - **Monitor**: 100-1000 MB usage
   - **Optimize**: >1 GB usage

## Real-World Applications

### Uber-Style Demand Forecasting

Based on Uber's approach described in the Analytics Vidhya guide:

```python
# Create features for demand forecasting
features = engine.create_demand_forecasting_features('ride_requests')

# Key features for ML models:
# - Spatial: neighbor demand patterns
# - Temporal: time-of-day, day-of-week patterns
# - Economic: supply-demand balance
# - Environmental: weather, events impact
```

### Smart City Applications

Comprehensive urban analytics combining multiple H3 capabilities:

```python
# Multi-modal analysis
spatial_patterns = spatial_analyzer.detect_hotspots('traffic_density')
demand_forecast = ml_engine.create_demand_forecasting_features('transport_demand')
evacuation_plans = disaster_analyzer.analyze_evacuation_zones('flood_risk', 'population')

# Integrated city dashboard metrics
livability_score = calculate_livability_index(grid)
sustainability_metrics = calculate_sustainability_index(grid)
```

## Best Practices
