# GEO-INFER-COMMS

Communications within and outside of the project.

## Overview

The GEO-INFER-COMMS module serves as the central nervous system for all communication activities related to the GEO-INFER framework. Its primary goal is to ensure clear, effective, and timely dissemination of information both internally among project contributors and externally to stakeholders, users, and the broader community. This encompasses a wide range of functions, from facilitating seamless collaboration for a distributed development team to crafting compelling narratives around geospatial data for public engagement. The module aims to provide the tools, strategies, and platforms necessary to build a vibrant, informed, and engaged ecosystem around GEO-INFER.

- **Benefits:** Increased public understanding of complex issues, enhanced transparency, support for data-driven advocacy.

### 4. Geospatial Storytelling & Narrative Crafting
- **Description:** Frameworks and methodologies for constructing compelling narratives around geospatial data, analyses, and project impacts. This involves combining maps, data, text, and multimedia elements.
- **連携:** Leverages outputs from GEO-INFER-SPACE, GEO-INFER-TIME, and GEO-INFER-AI.
- **Examples:** Story maps, data-driven journalism pieces, educational modules, interactive case studies.
- **Benefits:** Makes complex geospatial information more relatable and memorable, effective for education and outreach, can drive policy change.

### 5. Community Management & Moderation
- **Description:** Processes and tools for fostering a healthy, inclusive, and productive online community. This includes setting community guidelines, moderating discussions, and onboarding new members.
- **Platforms:** Forums, Discord/Slack communities, GitHub Discussions.
- **Benefits:** Positive and welcoming environment, encourages participation, manages conflicts constructively.

### 6. Documentation Dissemination & Feedback Channels
- **Description:** Ensuring that technical documentation (managed by GEO-INFER-INTRA) is easily accessible, discoverable, and that users have clear channels to provide feedback or ask for clarification.
- **Mechanisms:** ReadTheDocs integration, in-app help links, dedicated feedback forms, documentation issue trackers.
- **Benefits:** Improved user experience, up-to-date documentation, community-driven documentation improvements.
