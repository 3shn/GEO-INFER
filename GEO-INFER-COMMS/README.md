## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Core GEO-INFER framework installed
- Message broker system (e.g., RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka, or Redis for lightweight implementations)
- Network libraries (e.g., ZeroMQ, gRPC, websockets)
- For IoT integration: relevant IoT protocols (MQTT, CoAP)

### Installation
```bash
pip install -e ./GEO-INFER-COMMS
```

### Configuration
Basic configuration might include:
- Message broker connection details
- Network topology settings
- Security credentials
- Quality of service parameters

These are typically stored in `config/comms_config.yaml`.

### Basic Usage Examples

**1. Setting Up a Geospatial Pub/Sub System**
```python
from geo_infer_comms.messaging import GeoPubSub

# Initialize the messaging system
geo_pubsub = GeoPubSub(config_path="config/comms_config.yaml")

# Define a spatial area of interest (using a GeoJSON-like structure)
area_of_interest = {
    "type": "Polygon",
    "coordinates": [[
        [-122.51, 37.77],
        [-122.51, 37.78],
        [-122.50, 37.78],
        [-122.50, 37.77],
        [-122.51, 37.77]
    ]]
}

# Subscribe to messages within this area
subscription = geo_pubsub.subscribe(
    topic="environmental_sensors",
    spatial_filter=area_of_interest,
    callback=lambda message: print(f"Received data: {message}")
)

# Publish a message with spatial context
geo_pubsub.publish(
    topic="environmental_sensors",
    message={"temperature": 22.5, "humidity": 65.2, "timestamp": "2023-06-15T13:45:00Z"},
    location={"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-122.505, 37.775]}
)

# Clean up when done
geo_pubsub.unsubscribe(subscription)
geo_pubsub.close()
```

**2. Implementing a Field Data Synchronization System**
```python
from geo_infer_comms.sync import GeoDataSynchronizer
import geopandas as gpd

# Initialize synchronizer
synchronizer = GeoDataSynchronizer(
    local_storage_path="./local_geodata",
    remote_endpoint="https://central-server.example.com/sync"
)

# Load local dataset
local_data = gpd.read_file("./local_geodata/field_observations.geojson")

# Make some edits
# ... (editing operations on the GeoDataFrame)

# Synchronize changes
sync_result = synchronizer.sync(
    dataset_id="field_observations",
    data=local_data,
    conflict_resolution="last_modified_wins"
)

print(f"Synchronized {sync_result['features_sent']} features to server")
print(f"Received {sync_result['features_received']} new features from server")
print(f"Resolved {sync_result['conflicts']} conflicts")

# Check sync status
sync_status = synchronizer.get_sync_status()
for dataset, status in sync_status.items():
    print(f"Dataset '{dataset}': Last synced {status['last_sync_time']}, Status: {status['status']}")
```

**3. Setting Up a Geospatial Alert System**
```python
from geo_infer_comms.alerts import GeoAlertSystem
import datetime

# Initialize the alert system
alert_system = GeoAlertSystem(
    config_path="config/alerts_config.yaml",
    notification_channels=["sms", "email", "app_notification"]
)

# Define an alert condition based on a geographic area and threshold
alert_system.create_alert_rule(
    rule_id="flood_warning_downtown",
    condition={
        "data_source": "river_gauge_sensors",
        "parameter": "water_level",
        "operator": "greater_than",
        "threshold": 3.5,  # meters
        "duration": 30,    # minutes above threshold
    },
    area_of_interest="downtown_river_zone.geojson",
    message_template="FLOOD WARNING: River level at {value}m, exceeding the safe threshold of 3.5m in {location_name}",
    severity="high",
    notification_channels=["sms", "app_notification"]
)

# Manually trigger an alert (normally this would be event-driven)
alert_system.trigger_alert(
    rule_id="flood_warning_downtown",
    measurements=[
        {"sensor_id": "gauge_101", "value": 3.82, "timestamp": datetime.datetime.now(), 
         "location": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-122.156, 37.774]}}
    ],
    location_context={"location_name": "Downtown River District"}
)
