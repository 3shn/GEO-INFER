# Knowledge Base Usage

This guide explains how to use the GEO-INFER-INTRA Knowledge Base to access best practices, FAQs, troubleshooting guides, and other knowledge resources.

## Accessing the Knowledge Base

The Knowledge Base can be accessed through multiple interfaces:

### Web Interface

The Knowledge Base web interface is available at `http://localhost:8000/kb/` when the documentation server is running.

To start the documentation server:

```bash
geo-infer-intra docs serve
```

The web interface provides:
- Browsable categories of knowledge articles
- Full-text search capabilities
- Filtering by tags and categories
- User-friendly article display

### Command Line Interface

The Knowledge Base can also be accessed through the command line interface:

```bash
# Search the knowledge base
geo-infer-intra kb search "coordinate transformation"

# List all articles in a category
geo-infer-intra kb list best-practices

# Get a specific article
geo-infer-intra kb get best-practices/data_management
```

### API Interface

For programmatic access, the Knowledge Base API is available:

```python
from geo_infer_intra.client import KnowledgeBaseClient

# Initialize the client
kb_client = KnowledgeBaseClient()

# Search for articles
results = kb_client.search("coordinate transformation")

# Get a specific article
article = kb_client.get_article("best-practices/data_management")

# Print article content
print(f"Title: {article.title}")
print(f"Category: {article.category}")
print(f"Tags: {', '.join(article.tags)}")
print(f"Last updated: {article.last_updated}")
print(f"Content:\n{article.content}")
```

## Searching the Knowledge Base

The Knowledge Base supports powerful search capabilities:

### Basic Search

To perform a basic search, enter keywords into the search box:

```bash
geo-infer-intra kb search "raster analysis performance"
```

### Advanced Search

For more specific searches, you can use advanced query syntax:

```bash
# Search by category
geo-infer-intra kb search "category:best-practices raster"

# Search by tags
geo-infer-intra kb search "tags:performance optimization"

# Search by date
geo-infer-intra kb search "updated:>2023-01-01"

# Combined search
geo-infer-intra kb search "category:troubleshooting tags:memory updated:>2023-01-01"
```

### Filtering Results
