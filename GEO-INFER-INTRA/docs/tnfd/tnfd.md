16 June 2025

The Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) will release a set of recommendations for upgrading market access to decision-useful nature data at COP30 this year following a programme of market consultations and pilot testing that begins this month. 

This new phase of work on nature-related data challenges led by TNFD and involving a wide range of partner organisations across the nature data value chain follows the release of a discussion paper at COP16 last year and a workshop held last month with global leaders in nature data at Kew Gardens, London. It will include pilot testing to inform further technical design specifications for a possible Nature Data Public Facility (NDPF) first proposed by the TNFD in 2023.

In conjunction with UNDP and support from the German Government International Climate Initiative (IKI), the TNFD is also launching a grand challenge to foster new technology solutions to enable small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) globally to undertake a rapid assessment of their nature-related issues.

Nature data value chain recommendations and pilot testing

Following positive market feedback to its Roadmap for Upgrading Market Access to Decision-useful Nature Data released at COP16 in Colombia in late 2024, the TNFD’s new phase of pilot testing will run until October 2025 and involve a wide range of implementation partners as well as a diverse group of over 40 upstream nature data providers and more than 20 downstream nature data users and market intermediaries across markets and sectors.

The pilot programme will:

Test and refine a set of nature-data principles that should define the future quality and ‘fitness for purpose’ for nature data; 
Test the quality of a representative sample of nature-related data sets and sources aligned with three market use cases – nature-related corporate reporting, target setting and transition planning;
Help to identify priority nature-data gaps in need of long-term funding to address coverage, quality and accessibility challenges; and 
Refine and articulate the needs of downstream market users of nature-related data, through user experience testing of the proposed Nature Data Public Facility (NDPF). This will result in a set of design specifications for the proposed NDPF. 
TNFD has assembled a team of global implementation partners for this phase of work, including UNEP-WCMC, Icebreaker One, EY, Esri, Addleshaw Goddard, the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), IUCN, Global Canopy, Capitals Coalition, the Group on Earth Observations Secretariat (GEOS), the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), the Future of Sustainable Data Alliance (FoSDA) and WWF.

A Grand Challenge to spark new technology solutions for nature-related assessment by SMEs

Every business across every sector has impacts and dependencies on nature that may create material risks and opportunities to their business, to their value chain partners and for society as a whole. It is vital for the future resilience of their own business that every company understand and assess its nature-related issues, irrespective of size and any external reporting requirements they may have.

The TNFD believes that new technology tools, including AI, can potentially transform the ability for SMEs to build this understanding of nature’s relevance to their business at minimal cost and without the in-house knowledge or expertise that might be expected of larger companies and financial institutions. Building on the widespread market uptake of its LEAP assessment approach, and in conjunction with UNDP and the Government of Germany’s International Climate Initiative (IKI), the TNFD is launching a Grand Challenge to spark technology-enabled assessment tools to support SMEs. Managed by Conservation X Labs, tech start-ups and entrepreneurs around the world will be invited to participate in the challenge, with a shortlist of the best solutions to be showcased at COP30 in Brazil in November.

Stewart Maginnis, Deputy Director General, IUCN:

“IUCN is delighted to partner with TNFD in its pilot testing programme on how to provide the private sector with ready access to the most credible, nature-related data. IUCN has a long history of providing high-quality conservation knowledge, tools and analytics to guide both public and private interventions for the protection and restoration of species and ecosystems. We are therefore excited to be a partner in establishing nature data principles that will facilitate easier access to critical data, thereby contributing to impactful decision-making while ensuring necessary resources are secured for the generation, maintenance and strengthening of conservation knowledge.”

Yana Gevorgyan, Director, GEO Secretariat:

“Access to the right nature data, in the right format and at the right time, is essential for businesses and financial institutions seeking to assess and manage their nature-related dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities. Through initiatives like the Global Ecosystems Atlas, we provide spatial data on the state of all the world’s ecosystems – a foundational input for valuing nature and informing decisions. Collaboration across the nature data value chain is essential, and we are proud to support the TNFD’s pilot and broader efforts to make nature-related data more accessible, actionable, and aligned with user needs.”

Peter Rabley, CEO, Open Geospatial Consortium:

“At OGC, we believe that unlocking the full value of nature-related data requires a shared foundation—common data principles, agreed standards, and deep collaboration across sectors. As the complexity and urgency of global environmental challenges increase, we see a growing need for interoperable, trustworthy data that supports better decisions at every level. We’re proud to partner with TNFD in this important work, and we remain committed to advancing open, standards-based approaches that help nature data flow more effectively—across technologies, geographies, and institutions.”

Maxim Vergeichik, Team Lead on Private Sector Engagement, UNDP Nature Hub:

“Unlocking the full potential of the assessment of nature-related issues requires inclusive and affordable solutions. Artificial intelligence can help small and medium-sized enterprises to take action on their dependencies and impacts on nature as well as risks to their own business operations at low cost and without excessive in-house expertise. Our partnership with TNFD in this area opens up access to nature action by enterprises and communities in emerging markets. Through partnerships like this, we are building a foundation for competitive and resilient economies.”

Paul Bunje, President and Co-Founder, Conservation X Labs:

“Open innovation enables us to source transformative ideas from anywhere in the world—engineers in Nairobi, coders in Bangalore, conservationists in Manaus—bringing forward solutions that are as diverse and dynamic as the ecosystems we seek to protect. The TNFD has already embraced the power of open innovation to develop its LEAP assessment approach and we look forward to partnering with them to make those assessment tools accessible for SMEs around the world – for the good of their own business and for the good of the planet”

Jack Dangermond, President and Founder, Esri

“Esri is collaborating with TNFD to streamline access to purpose-specific geospatial data within the TNFD community through an open data explorer, the Nature Data Public Facility (NDPF) aligned with the LEAP (Locate, Evaluate, Assess, and Prepare)  approach, with a goal of simplifying the complex data intensive reporting requirements.  TNFD will be a valuable addition to the OGC community, bringing their unique ESG knowledge and skills in ontologies and reporting standardization.”

About the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD):
The Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) is comprised of 40 business and finance leaders from around the world and was launched in 2021 with the support of the G20. TNFD provides recommendations and guidance for market participants and other stakeholders about how nature beyond climate should be assessed, managed and reported. It has built a global movement of support and action, including over 500 organisations and over USD 17 trillion in assets under management (AUM) now committed to reporting their nature-related issues aligned with the TNFD recommendations published in September 2023. The TNFD recommendations build on the previous approach and recommendation of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and are aligned with the impact standards of the GRI, the European Union’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and the sustainability reporting standards of the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB).

# TNFD Commences Next Phase of Work on Nature-Related Data Solutions: A Comprehensive Analysis

## Executive Summary

The Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) has launched an ambitious next phase of work focused on enhancing global access to high-quality nature-related data solutions[1]. This comprehensive initiative, announced in June 2025, represents a critical evolution in the organization's mission to transform how businesses and financial institutions assess, manage, and disclose their nature-related risks and opportunities[1][2]. The program encompasses two primary components: extensive pilot testing of a Nature Data Public Facility (NDPF) and a grand challenge to foster innovative technology solutions for small and medium enterprises (SMEs)[1][3].

## Background and Context

### The TNFD Framework Foundation

The Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures was established in 2021 as a global, market-led initiative comprising 40 individual members representing financial institutions, corporates, and market service providers with over USD 20.6 trillion in assets and a footprint in over 180 countries[4]. The organization's primary mission is to develop and deliver a risk management and disclosure framework for entities to report and act on evolving nature-related risks, ultimately supporting a shift in global financial flows away from nature-negative outcomes toward nature-positive outcomes[4][5].

The TNFD framework builds upon the successful foundation of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), adopting the same four pillars: governance, strategy, risk and impact management, and metrics and targets[6][7]. However, the TNFD framework introduces critical adaptations specific to nature-related issues, including enhanced focus on location-specific assessments, stakeholder engagement with Indigenous peoples and local communities, and comprehensive value chain impact analysis[8].

### Growing Adoption and Market Recognition

The TNFD framework has experienced remarkable adoption growth, with over 502 organizations committed as Early Adopters by October 2024, representing approximately $6.5 trillion in market capitalization and $17.7 trillion in assets under management[9]. This represents a significant increase from the initial 320 Early Adopters announced in January 2024[9][10]. The diverse adopter base spans 50 jurisdictions and encompasses 62 out of 77 SICS sectors, including notable organizations such as Volvo, Ricoh, China Mengniu Dairy Ltd, Acciona, LGIM, and MUFG Asset Management[10].

## The Next Phase Initiative: Comprehensive Overview

### Strategic Foundation and Timing

The current phase of work builds upon significant foundational activities, including the release of a discussion paper at COP16 in Colombia in October 2024 and a workshop held with global leaders in nature data at Kew Gardens, London, in May 2025[1][11]. This strategic progression reflects the TNFD's systematic approach to addressing critical market failures in nature-related data provision[12][13].

The initiative directly responds to identified challenges in the current nature data landscape, including issues with accessibility, quality, comparability, and reliability of nature-related information[14]. Market participants, particularly financial institutions, face significant obstacles in sourcing credible information needed for portfolio-level nature targets and compliance with emerging regulations such as the EU's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive[14].

### Component 1: Nature Data Public Facility (NDPF) Development

#### Technical Specifications and Design Philosophy

The Nature Data Public Facility represents a groundbreaking approach to addressing global nature data challenges through a distributed, open-access platform[13]. The NDPF is modeled on the successful Net Zero Data Public Utility, which aggregates climate information from various sources including Bloomberg and CDP, providing free access to stakeholders[14][15].

The facility's design principles emphasize data sovereignty, maintaining ownership and responsibility with original data providers including national governments and local stakeholders[13]. This distributed approach offers several advantages: supporting future data quality upgrades across the value chain, maintaining scalability over time, and serving as a foundational data stack for broader market-based solutions[13].

#### Key Stakeholder Groups and Use Cases

The NDPF is designed to serve diverse stakeholder groups with varying data needs and operational scales[13]. Primary stakeholders include insurance companies and globally significant universal asset owners with portfolios comprising thousands of discrete equity holdings, each with geographically dispersed operating footprints across different geographies and biomes[14][13].

The facility will focus on housing information about the state of nature rather than direct company impacts on ecosystems, creating a complementary resource to existing corporate disclosure frameworks[14]. This approach enables upstream pilot testing of data fitness for organizations providing data while facilitating downstream testing of optimal data delivery methods for diverse market participants[13].

#### Governance and Funding Considerations

The long-term governance structure of the NDPF remains under development, with significant government support already secured[13]. The German government has committed €29 million through the International Climate Initiative (IKI) for a six-year period to support TNFD's framework development and market engagement activities[16]. The UK government has also offered funding support for the data facility development[17].

The TNFD will evaluate whether to commission a permanent new open-source Nature Data Public Facility or invest in upgrading an existing data platform to meet specific requirements[13]. Alongside cost, quality, and open access considerations, the organization is exploring the potential for a circular nature data economy that could enable data exchange between traditional and new data providers[13].

### Component 2: Grand Challenge for SME Technology Solutions

#### Partnership Structure and Leadership

The Grand Challenge represents a collaborative effort led by Conservation X Labs and supported by UNDP and the German Government's International Climate Initiative[3][18]. This partnership leverages Conservation X Labs' expertise in fostering innovation to prevent biodiversity loss and their commitment to creating transformative solutions at the intersection of biodiversity, technology, and innovation[19].

UNDP's involvement brings significant value through their private sector engagement capabilities and focus on emerging markets[2]. As Maxim Vergeichik, Team Lead on Private Sector Engagement at UNDP Nature Hub, noted: "Artificial intelligence can help small and medium-sized enterprises to take action on their dependencies and impacts on nature as well as risks to their own business operations at low cost and without excessive in-house expertise"[2].

#### Technology Innovation Focus Areas

The Grand Challenge specifically targets the development of artificial intelligence and digital solutions that enable SMEs to conduct rapid assessments of their nature-related issues[3][2]. This focus addresses a critical gap in the market, as traditional nature assessment methodologies often require significant in-house expertise and resources that are beyond the reach of smaller organizations[2].

The challenge encourages participation from tech start-ups and entrepreneurs worldwide, with shortlisted solutions set to be presented at COP30[3]. This timeline aligns with the broader international climate and biodiversity agenda, providing a high-profile platform for innovative solutions to gain recognition and potential implementation[20].

## The LEAP Approach and Assessment Methodology

### Comprehensive Framework Design

The TNFD's LEAP (Locate, Evaluate, Assess, Prepare) approach provides the methodological foundation for nature-related assessments across organizations of all sizes and sectors[21][22]. This integrated approach has been pilot-tested by over 240 organizations globally, demonstrating its practical applicability and effectiveness[22].

The LEAP methodology addresses four critical phases: locating an organization's interface with nature to define priority assets, evaluating dependencies and impacts on natural assets and ecosystem services, assessing transformation of dependency and impact results into risk and opportunity studies, and preparing strategies and actions to manage risks and capitalize on opportunities[23][21].

### Integration with Existing Standards

The LEAP approach integrates existing frameworks such as the Natural Capital Protocol and Science-Based Targets for Nature while addressing systemic interconnections between ecosystems, organizations, and financial markets[22]. This integration approach ensures compatibility with existing sustainability reporting frameworks including the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and emerging regulations such as the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS)[23].

Organizations implementing the LEAP approach have demonstrated flexible applications tailored to their specific operational contexts, industries, and sustainability objectives[9]. Early adopters have particularly emphasized the interconnected nature of climate and nature issues, leveraging integrated risk assessments and reporting practices developed in alignment with TCFD recommendations[9].

## Global Partnership Network and Collaboration

### Strategic Partnerships Across the Data Value Chain

The TNFD's next phase involves an extensive network of partner organizations spanning the entire nature data value chain[1]. Key partners include UNEP-WCMC, Icebreaker One, Esri, Addleshaw Goddard, Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), IUCN, Global Canopy, Capitals Coalition, Group on Earth Observations (GEO), GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility), The Future of Sustainable Data Alliance (FoSDA), WWF, UNDP, and EY[1][24].

This collaborative approach ensures comprehensive expertise across technical, legal, scientific, and commercial domains necessary for successful nature data infrastructure development[1]. The partnership model reflects the TNFD's recognition that addressing nature data challenges requires coordinated action across multiple sectors and disciplines[15].

### WWF Geospatial ESG Consortium Integration

A particularly significant partnership involves deeper collaboration with WWF and their geospatial ESG consortium, developed with Responsible Risk to gain insights on natural value benefits for global biodiversity[15][25]. This consortium includes Ordnance Survey, Innovate UK Business Connect, Group on Earth Observations, and University of Zurich, among others[15].

The consortium's work focuses on applying geospatial data to improve financial actors' ability to differentiate on environmental performance and aid capital realignment toward sustainable development[25]. Their 2023 Biodiversity Data Puzzle Report outlined how improved ecosystem and biodiversity insights could be consistently produced for every commercial asset on Earth using geospatially-driven approaches[25].

## Roadmap Development and Implementation Timeline

### Three-Phase Strategic Approach

The TNFD has developed a comprehensive roadmap with three key priorities for pilot testing in 2025, leading to final recommendations in late 2025[11][13]. The first priority involves developing a composite set of nature data principles, building on existing scientific, open data, and corporate assurance data standards[11].

The second priority focuses on testing existing nature data sets and sources with upstream data providers against established standards to scope coverage and quality gaps for future investment priorities[11]. The third priority involves further specification of market needs and use cases for high-quality, assurable nature-related data through beta version testing of the NDPF[11].

### Public Consultation and Stakeholder Engagement

The roadmap includes extensive public consultation opportunities, with feedback collection open until January 17, 2025, for the discussion paper released at COP16[11]. This consultative approach ensures broad stakeholder input in shaping the final framework and implementation strategy[13].

The consultation process builds on positive government and market feedback to earlier scoping studies, demonstrating strong stakeholder support for enhanced nature data infrastructure[13]. The TNFD has received significant interest from data providers and data users, including financial institutions, for participating in pilot testing activities[14].

## Alignment with Global Biodiversity Framework

### International Policy Integration

The TNFD framework aligns closely with the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework adopted at COP15 in December 2022[8]. This historic framework sets ambitious pathways to reach the global vision of a world living in harmony with nature by 2050, including four goals for 2050 and 23 targets for 2030[8].

Specifically, the TNFD supports implementation of Target 15 of the Global Biodiversity Framework, which explicitly calls for legal, administrative, and policy measures to encourage large and transnational companies and financial institutions to regularly monitor, assess, and transparently disclose their risks, dependencies, and impacts on biodiversity[26][27].

### Supporting Regulatory Compliance

The framework addresses growing regulatory requirements across multiple jurisdictions, including the EU's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, which requires large institutions to report material exposure to risks, opportunities, and impacts associated with biodiversity, water, waste, and ecosystems[14]. The TNFD's approach provides practical implementation guidance for organizations seeking to comply with these emerging regulatory requirements[8].

## Market Impact and Future Implications

### Financial Market Transformation

The TNFD initiative represents a fundamental shift in how financial markets assess and price nature-related risks and opportunities[14]. With over $6.5 trillion in market capitalization represented by Early Adopters, the framework has the potential to redirect significant capital flows toward nature-positive outcomes[9].

Investors face growing pressure to set portfolio-level targets for nature and include nature considerations in climate transition strategies[14]. The enhanced data infrastructure being developed through the NDPF will provide critical decision-making tools for these assessments[13].

### Technology Innovation Catalyst

The Grand Challenge component positions the TNFD as a catalyst for technological innovation in nature assessment and management[3]. By fostering AI and digital solutions specifically designed for SMEs, the initiative addresses a significant market gap while promoting broader adoption of nature-related assessment practices[2].

The focus on emerging markets through UNDP partnership ensures that innovative solutions will be accessible to organizations in developing economies, supporting global biodiversity conservation efforts[2].

## Conclusion

The TNFD's next phase of work on nature-related data solutions represents a pivotal moment in the evolution of sustainability reporting and risk management[1]. Through the comprehensive development of the Nature Data Public Facility and the innovative Grand Challenge for SME technology solutions, the initiative addresses critical market failures while fostering technological innovation[1][3].

The success of this initiative will depend on sustained collaboration across the extensive partner network, continued government and private sector support, and effective integration with existing regulatory and standard-setting frameworks[1][15]. With pilot testing scheduled throughout 2025 and final recommendations expected by late 2025, the coming period will be crucial for establishing the foundation of a transformed nature data ecosystem[11].

The implications extend far beyond technical data infrastructure, potentially reshaping how businesses understand and manage their relationships with nature while providing investors with the decision-useful information necessary for capital allocation toward biodiversity conservation and ecosystem restoration[13][14]. As the world approaches COP30, the TNFD's work positions nature-related financial disclosures as a critical tool for achieving global biodiversity objectives and sustainable economic development[3][20].
