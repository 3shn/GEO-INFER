## Introduction to Reasoning

Ontology reasoning refers to deriving logical consequences from a set of explicitly asserted facts or axioms. In GEO-INFER-INTRA, reasoning extends the capabilities of the knowledge base by inferring implicit knowledge from explicit statements.

```mermaid

    EXPLICIT[Explicit Knowledge] --> REASONER[Reasoner]
    RULES[Reasoning Rules] --> REASONER
    REASONER --> IMPLICIT[Implicit Knowledge]
    EXPLICIT --> KB[Knowledge Base]

        C["isCapitalOf(Albany, New York State)"] --> R
        D["contains(New York State, New York)"] --> R
        R --> E["isIn(New York, New York State)"]
    end

### Benefits of Reasoning

- **Knowledge Enrichment**: Derive new facts from existing knowledge
- **Consistency Checking**: Detect logical inconsistencies in the knowledge base
- **Query Enhancement**: Improve search results by including inferred knowledge
- **Knowledge Validation**: Verify that the knowledge base adheres to domain rules
- **Automated Classification**: Organize entities based on their properties

## Types of Reasoning

### Deductive Reasoning

Drawing logical conclusions from premises known to be true.

```mermaid
graph TD
    PREMISE1[Premise 1] --> CONCLUSION[Conclusion]
    PREMISE2[Premise 2] --> CONCLUSION
    
    subgraph "Example"
        A["All cities have population"] --> C["London has population"]
        B["London is a city"] --> C
    end
    
    classDef concept fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    classDef example fill:#dfd,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    
    class PREMISE1,PREMISE2,CONCLUSION concept
    class A,B,C example
```

### Inductive Reasoning

Deriving general principles from specific observations.

```mermaid
graph TD
    OBSERVATION1[Observation 1] --> PATTERN[Pattern]
    OBSERVATION2[Observation 2] --> PATTERN
    OBSERVATION3[Observation 3] --> PATTERN
    PATTERN --> GENERALIZATION[Generalization]
    
    subgraph "Example"
        A["City A has high pollution"] --> P["Pattern: Cities with high traffic have high pollution"]
        B["City B has high pollution"] --> P
        C["City A and B have high traffic"] --> P
        P --> G["Cities with high traffic likely have high pollution"]
    end
    
    classDef concept fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    classDef example fill:#dfd,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    
    class OBSERVATION1,OBSERVATION2,OBSERVATION3,PATTERN,GENERALIZATION concept
    class A,B,C,P,G example
```

### Abductive Reasoning

Finding the most likely explanation for observations.

```mermaid
graph TD
    OBSERVATION[Observation] --> HYPOTHESIS1[Hypothesis 1]
    OBSERVATION --> HYPOTHESIS2[Hypothesis 2]
    OBSERVATION --> HYPOTHESIS3[Hypothesis 3]
    HYPOTHESIS1 --> EVALUATION[Evaluation]
    HYPOTHESIS2 --> EVALUATION
    HYPOTHESIS3 --> EVALUATION
    EVALUATION --> BESTEXPLANATION[Best Explanation]
    
    subgraph "Example"
        O["Flooded areas detected"] --> H1["Heavy rainfall occurred"]
        O --> H2["Dam failure occurred"]
        O --> H3["Snow melt occurred"]
        H1 --> E["Evaluate probabilities"]
        H2 --> E
        H3 --> E
        E --> B["Heavy rainfall is most likely cause"]
    end
    
    classDef concept fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    classDef example fill:#dfd,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    
    class OBSERVATION,HYPOTHESIS1,HYPOTHESIS2,HYPOTHESIS3,EVALUATION,BESTEXPLANATION concept
    class O,H1,H2,H3,E,B example
```

### Description Logic Reasoning

Reasoning over structured knowledge using formal description logic.

```mermaid

    class TBOX,ABOX,REASONER components
    class SUBSUMPTION,INSTANCE,CONSISTENCY results
```

    QUERY --> API[API Layer]
    VALIDATION --> API
    SEARCH --> API
    
    classDef storage fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    classDef core fill:#dfd,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    classDef services fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    classDef interface fill:#ffd,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    
    class ONTO,RULES,KB,INFERENCE storage

  cache_size_mb: 512
  cache_ttl_minutes: 60
  
  # Rule settings
  custom_rules_enabled: true
  custom_rules_path: "config/rules/"
```

## Geospatial Reasoning Rules

### Topological Relations

Rules for inferring topological relationships between spatial features.

```
# RCC8 Composition Table (Partial)
# If region A is inside region B and region B is inside region C,
# then region A is inside region C
RULE: inside(?a, ?b) AND inside(?b, ?c) -> inside(?a, ?c)

# If region A contains region B and region B contains region C,
# then region A contains region C
RULE: contains(?a, ?b) AND contains(?b, ?c) -> contains(?a, ?c)

# If region A overlaps region B and region B is inside region C,
# then region A overlaps region C
RULE: overlaps(?a, ?b) AND inside(?b, ?c) -> overlaps(?a, ?c)
```

### Spatial Hierarchy Rules

Rules for inferring relationships in spatial hierarchies.

```
# Administrative hierarchy
# If city A is in state B and state B is in country C,
# then city A is in country C
RULE: City(?a) AND State(?b) AND Country(?c) AND isIn(?a, ?b) AND isIn(?b, ?c) -> isIn(?a, ?c)

# Water body hierarchy
# If stream A flows into river B and river B flows into water body C,
# then stream A is part of water system C
RULE: Stream(?a) AND River(?b) AND WaterBody(?c) AND flowsInto(?a, ?b) AND flowsInto(?b, ?c) -> partOf(?a, ?c)
```

### Proximity Rules

Rules for inferring spatial proximity relationships.

```
# Proximity-based risk inference
# If location A is within 10km of an active volcano B,
# then location A has volcanic risk
RULE: Location(?a) AND Volcano(?b) AND isActive(?b, true) AND distance(?a, ?b, ?d) AND lessThan(?d, 10) -> hasRisk(?a, "volcanic")

# Service area inference
# If a service point A has radius B and location C is within distance B of A,
# then location C is served by service point A
RULE: ServicePoint(?a) AND hasRadius(?a, ?r) AND Location(?c) AND distance(?a, ?c, ?d) AND lessThan(?d, ?r) -> servedBy(?c, ?a)
```

## Integration with Knowledge Base

The reasoner integrates with the knowledge base to enhance search, querying, and knowledge discovery capabilities.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Query Processing"
        QUERY[User Query] --> EXPANSION[Query Expansion]
        EXPANSION --> EXECUTION[Query Execution]
        EXPLICIT[Explicit Knowledge] --> EXECUTION
        INFERRED[Inferred Knowledge] --> EXECUTION
        EXECUTION --> RESULTS[Results]
    end
    
    subgraph "Reasoning Process"
        KB[Knowledge Base] --> EXTRACTION[Knowledge Extraction]
        EXTRACTION --> REASONING[Reasoning Process]
        ONTO[Ontology] --> REASONING
        RULES[Rules] --> REASONING
        REASONING --> VALIDATION[Validation]
        VALIDATION --> MATERIALIZATION[Materialization]
        MATERIALIZATION --> INTEGRATION[Knowledge Integration]
        INTEGRATION --> KB
    end
    
    classDef query fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    classDef reasoning fill:#dfd,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    
    class QUERY,EXPANSION,EXECUTION,EXPLICIT,INFERRED,RESULTS query
    class KB,EXTRACTION,REASONING,ONTO,RULES,VALIDATION,MATERIALIZATION,INTEGRATION reasoning
```

### Example: Query Enhancement with Reasoning

```python
from geo_infer.ontology import OntologyManager
from geo_infer.knowledge_base import KnowledgeBase
from geo_infer.reasoning import ReasoningService

# Initialize components
ontology = OntologyManager().get_ontology("geospatial")
kb = KnowledgeBase()
reasoner = ReasoningService(ontology)

# Enable reasoning
reasoner.set_reasoning_level("FULL")
kb.set_reasoner(reasoner)

# Original query: Find all water bodies in California
original_query = "water bodies in California"
original_results = kb.search(original_query)
print(f"Original results count: {len(original_results)}")

# Enhanced query using reasoning
# This will also find instances of subclasses of WaterBody
# and water bodies in regions that are part of California
enhanced_query = reasoner.enhance_query(original_query)
enhanced_results = kb.search(enhanced_query)
print(f"Enhanced results count: {len(enhanced_results)}")

# Show inferred knowledge
for result in enhanced_results:
    if result not in original_results:
        print(f"Inferred result: {result}")
        print(f"Inference path: {reasoner.explain_inference(result)}")
```

## Performance Optimization

### Materialization Strategies

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Materialization Strategies"
        EAGER[Eager Materialization] --> PROS1[Faster Query Time]
        EAGER --> CONS1[Higher Storage Requirements]
        
        LAZY[Lazy Materialization] --> PROS2[Lower Storage Requirements]
        LAZY --> CONS2[Higher Query Time]
        
        HYBRID[Hybrid Approach] --> PROS3[Balanced Performance]
        HYBRID --> CONS3[Complexity]
    end
    
    subgraph "Implementation"
        STRATEGY[Materialization Strategy] --> CONFIG[Configuration]
        CONFIG --> MONITORING[Performance Monitoring]
        MONITORING --> ADAPTIVE[Adaptive Strategy]
        ADAPTIVE --> STRATEGY
    end
    
    classDef strategies fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    classDef implementation fill:#dfd,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    
    class EAGER,LAZY,HYBRID,PROS1,CONS1,PROS2,CONS2,PROS3,CONS3 strategies
    class STRATEGY,CONFIG,MONITORING,ADAPTIVE implementation
```

### Incremental Reasoning

Updating inference results based on changes to the knowledge base, rather than re-computing all inferences.

```python
from geo_infer.reasoning import IncrementalReasoner

# Initialize the incremental reasoner
reasoner = IncrementalReasoner(ontology)

# Process initial knowledge base
reasoner.materialize(kb)

# When knowledge base changes
def on_kb_update(changes):
    # changes contains added and removed statements
    reasoner.update(changes)
    
    # Get affected inferences
    affected = reasoner.get_affected_inferences(changes)
    
    # Update cache or indexes as needed
    update_cache(affected)
```

### Reasoning Optimization Techniques

- **Selective Materialization**: Only materialize frequently accessed inference paths
- **Parallel Reasoning**: Distribute reasoning tasks across multiple threads or nodes
- **Query-Driven Reasoning**: Perform reasoning only for relevant portions of the ontology
- **Approximation**: Use approximate reasoning for large-scale datasets
- **Indexing**: Create specialized indexes for common reasoning patterns

## Use Cases

### Environmental Impact Assessment

    class LANDCOVER,PROTECTED,SPECIES,DEVELOPMENT kb
    class HABITAT,IMPACT,PROTECTION rules
    class AFFECTED,SEVERITY,MITIGATION inferred

      hasLocation(?h, ?hloc) AND intersects(?loc, ?hloc) AND 
      hasSpecies(?h, ?s) AND isProtected(?s, true) -> 
      impactsSpecies(?d, ?s)

# Impact severity rule
RULE: Development(?d) AND impactsSpecies(?d, ?s) AND 
      hasCriticalityStatus(?s, "endangered") ->
      hasImpactSeverity(?d, "high")

# Mitigation requirement rule
RULE: Development(?d) AND hasImpactSeverity(?d, "high") ->
      requiresMitigation(?d, "comprehensive")
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Possible Causes | Solutions |
|-------|----------------|-----------|
| Slow reasoning performance | Large ontology size, Complex rules, Inefficient materialization | Use incremental reasoning, Optimize rules, Adjust materialization strategy |
| Inconsistent ontology | Contradictory assertions, Incompatible rules | Run consistency checker, Review rule interactions, Add disjointness axioms |
| Memory issues | Excessive materialization, Large datasets | Implement paging, Use selective materialization, Increase memory allocation |
| Unexpected inference results | Rule interactions, Missing constraints | Enable explanation generation, Review rule precedence, Add negative constraints |
| Integration errors | API incompatibilities, Version mismatches | Check version compatibility, Review API documentation, Use adapters |

### Debugging Tools

GEO-INFER-INTRA provides several tools for debugging reasoning issues:

- **Explanation Generator**: Traces the inference path for derived knowledge
- **Rule Profiler**: Identifies rules that consume the most resources
- **Consistency Checker**: Detects logical contradictions in the knowledge base
- **Performance Monitor**: Tracks reasoning time and resource usage
- **Visualization Tools**: Graphically represents inference paths and rule interactions

```python
from geo_infer.reasoning import Debugger

# Initialize debugger
debugger = Debugger(reasoner)

# Explain an inference
explanation = debugger.explain_inference(inferred_statement)
debugger.visualize_explanation(explanation, "explanation.html")

# Profile rule performance
profile = debugger.profile_rules(kb)
print("Top 5 most expensive rules:")
for rule, stats in profile.get_top_rules(5):
    print(f"Rule: {rule}")
    print(f"Execution time: {stats.execution_time}ms")
    print(f"Inferences generated: {stats.inference_count}")

# Check consistency
consistency_result = debugger.check_consistency(kb)
if not consistency_result.is_consistent:
    print("Inconsistencies detected:")
    for conflict in consistency_result.conflicts:
        print(f"Conflict: {conflict}")
        print(f"Involved axioms: {conflict.get_axioms()}")
```
