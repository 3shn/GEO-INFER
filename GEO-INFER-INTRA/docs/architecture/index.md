## System Components

GEO-INFER-INTRA is composed of the following primary components:

1. **Documentation System** - Manages and serves documentation content
2. **Ontology Manager** - Maintains geospatial ontologies and terminologies
3. **Workflow Engine** - Executes and monitors geospatial workflows
4. **Knowledge Base** - Stores and retrieves knowledge articles
5. **API Layer** - Provides programmatic access to all components
6. **User Interface** - Delivers interactive user interfaces for all components
7. **Integration Services** - Connects with other GEO-INFER modules

## Component Interactions

The components interact through well-defined interfaces:

- **Documentation System** ↔ **Knowledge Base**: Documentation content is stored and retrieved from the Knowledge Base
- **Ontology Manager** ↔ **Knowledge Base**: Ontology definitions are stored in the Knowledge Base
- **Workflow Engine** ↔ **API Layer**: Workflows are defined and executed through the API
- **User Interface** ↔ **API Layer**: User interactions are processed through the API
- **Integration Services** ↔ **Other Modules**: External services are accessed through integration points

## Technical Stack

GEO-INFER-INTRA is built on the following technologies:

- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI for API services
- **Documentation**: Markdown with MkDocs for documentation generation
- **Ontology**: OWL/RDF with RDFLib for ontology management
- **Workflow**: Custom workflow engine with Celery for task execution
- **Knowledge Base**: Elasticsearch for full-text search
- **User Interface**: React with TypeScript for web interfaces
- **Integration**: Protocol Buffers and gRPC for inter-module communication

## Deployment Options

GEO-INFER-INTRA supports multiple deployment options:

1. **Single-Node Deployment** - All components on a single server
2. **Microservices Deployment** - Components distributed across multiple services
3. **Containerized Deployment** - Docker containers orchestrated with Kubernetes
4. **Serverless Deployment** - Selected components deployed as serverless functions
