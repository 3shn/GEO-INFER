## Core Analysis Types

### Vector Analysis

Operations performed on vector data (points, lines, polygons):

- **Overlay Operations** - Union, intersection, identity, clip, erase
- **Proximity Analysis** - Buffers, Thiessen/Voronoi polygons, distance calculations
- **Geometric Measurements** - Area, length, perimeter, centroid

### Raster Analysis

Operations performed on raster data (grids/images):

- **Local Operations** - Cell-by-cell calculations
- **Focal Operations** - Analysis using a neighborhood around each cell
- **Zonal Operations** - Analysis based on zones or regions
- **Global Operations** - Calculations across the entire raster

### Network Analysis

Analysis of connected linear features:

- **Optimal Routing** - Shortest path, traveling salesperson problem
- **Service Area Analysis** - Areas accessible within constraints
- **Origin-Destination Analysis** - Flow and allocation between locations

### Statistical Analysis

Methods for understanding spatial patterns:

- **Spatial Autocorrelation** - Measuring spatial dependency
- **Hot Spot Analysis** - Identifying clusters of high/low values
- **Regression Analysis** - Analyzing relationships between variables

## Workflow Integration

Spatial analysis can be integrated into GEO-INFER workflows through:

- Pre-defined analysis templates
- Custom analysis scripts
- Analysis chaining and parameter passing
- Results visualization and interpretation

## Applications

Spatial analysis supports various applications including:

- Urban planning and land use analysis
- Environmental monitoring and modeling
- Emergency management and disaster response
- Market analysis and location optimization
- Transportation planning and optimization
- Public health and epidemiology
- Crime analysis and prevention
