|--------|------------|-----------|---------------|-----------|----------|
| H3 | Hexagons | Aperture-7 | 64-bit integer | Uber | 2018 |
| S2 | Quadrilaterals | Quadtree | 64-bit integer | Google | 2011 |
| Geohash | Rectangles | Base-32 | String | Gustavo Niemeyer | 2008 |

## Cell Shape and Geometric Properties

### H3: Hexagonal Grid

**Advantages:**
- **Uniform Neighbor Relationships**: All 6 neighbors are equidistant from the center
- **Single Neighbor Type**: Only edge-sharing neighbors (no corner adjacency)
- **Optimal Perimeter-to-Area Ratio**: Approximates a circle better than other shapes
- **Consistent Distance Properties**: Cell centroids maintain relatively uniform distance

**Limitations:**
- **Requires Pentagons**: 12 pentagons per resolution level (at icosahedron vertices)
- **Non-perfect Subdivision**: Aperture-7 subdivision is approximate, not exact
- **Non-exact Containment**: Parent cells don't perfectly contain children

### S2: Quadrilateral Grid

**Advantages:**
- **Perfect Hierarchical Subdivision**: Each parent perfectly contains 4 children
- **Exact Bit Representation**: Efficient encoding of location and hierarchy
- **No Anomalies**: Unlike H3's pentagons, S2 has consistent cell types
- **Simpler Implementation**: Square subdivision is mathematically simpler

**Limitations:**
- **Two Types of Adjacency**: Edge and corner neighbors behave differently
- **Varying Neighbor Distances**: Distance from center to edge vs. corner neighbors differs
- **Projection Distortion**: Significant near poles and along cell edges

### Geohash: Rectangular Grid

**Advantages:**
- **Simple String Representation**: Human-readable alphanumeric encoding
- **Easy Prefix Matching**: Common prefixes indicate spatial proximity
- **Widely Implemented**: Supported in many databases and systems
- **Variable Precision**: Configurable by string length (1-12 characters)

**Limitations:**
- **Significant Distortion**: Cells vary greatly in size at different latitudes
- **Edge Effects**: Adjacent locations can have completely different hashes
- **Limited Precision**: Practical limit of 12 characters (~centimeter precision)

## Hierarchical Properties

### H3: Aperture-7 Hierarchy

- **Resolutions**: 16 levels (0-15)
- **Expansion Rate**: Each finer resolution has approximately 7x more cells
- **Scaling Factor**: Cell edge length scales by √7 between resolutions
- **Cell Counts**: 122 base cells at resolution 0, up to trillions at resolution 15

```
Base cells → 122
Resolution 1 → ~800
Resolution 2 → ~5,600
Resolution 3 → ~39,200
...
Resolution 9 → ~1.4 trillion
```

**Approximate Parent-Child Relationship:**
```
|---------------|
|       |       |
|   1   |   2   |
|       |       |
|---------------|
|       |       |
|   3   |   4   |
|       |       |
|---------------|
```

H3 parent cells don't perfectly contain their children, with up to 0.5% of a child's area potentially extending beyond the parent's boundary.

### S2: Quadtree Hierarchy

- **Levels**: 31 levels (0-30)
- **Expansion Rate**: Each finer level has exactly 4x more cells
- **Perfect Containment**: Children always fit exactly within parents
- **Bit Representation**: Each level uses 2 bits in the 64-bit representation

**Perfect Parent-Child Relationship:**
```
|-------|-------|
|       |       |
|   0   |   1   |
|       |       |
|-------|-------|
|       |       |
|   2   |   3   |
|       |       |
|-------|-------|
```

### Geohash: Base-32 Hierarchy

- **Precision Levels**: 12 character positions
- **Expansion Rate**: Each additional character provides 32x more precision
- **Alternating Pattern**: Subdivides alternately in longitude, then latitude
- **Bit Representation**: Each character encodes 5 bits (2^5 = 32)
