# H3 Database Integration

This document explores how to integrate H3 with various database systems for efficient geospatial querying and analysis.

## Database Extensions

### PostgreSQL with h3-pg

The [h3-pg](https://github.com/zachasme/h3-pg) extension brings H3 functionality directly into PostgreSQL/PostGIS.

#### Installation

```bash
# From source
git clone https://github.com/zachasme/h3-pg.git
cd h3-pg
make
make install

# Or with PostgreSQL extensions manager
pgxn install h3
```

#### Enabling the Extension

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION h3;
```

#### Core Functions

```sql
-- Convert points to H3 indices
SELECT h3_lat_lng_to_cell(37.7749, -122.4194, 9);

-- Get the boundary of an H3 cell as a PostGIS geometry
SELECT h3_cell_to_boundary('8928308281fffff'::h3index);

-- Get H3 indices within a PostGIS geometry
SELECT h3_polygon_to_cells(
  ST_GeomFromText('POLYGON((-122.4089 37.8036, -122.4089 37.7096, 
                            -122.3599 37.7096, -122.3599 37.8036, 
                            -122.4089 37.8036))'), 
  9
);
```

#### Creating an H3 Index

```sql
-- Create a table with H3 indices
CREATE TABLE h3_data (
  h3_index h3index PRIMARY KEY,
  value NUMERIC
);

-- Create an index on the H3 column
CREATE INDEX h3_idx ON h3_data (h3_index);
```

#### Efficient Spatial Queries

```sql
-- K-ring query (finding neighboring cells)
SELECT h3_grid_disk('8928308281fffff'::h3index, 1);

-- Finding all cells within a given distance of a point
SELECT h3_cell 
FROM h3_data 
WHERE h3_cell IN (
  SELECT h3_grid_disk(h3_lat_lng_to_cell(37.7749, -122.4194, 9), 2)
);
```

### BigQuery

Google BigQuery provides H3 functionality through its geospatial functions.

#### H3 Lookup Functions

```sql
-- Convert lat/lng to H3 index (as a STRING)
SELECT h3.ST_H3(ST_GEOGPOINT(-122.4194, 37.7749), 9) AS h3_index;

-- Get the boundary of an H3 cell
SELECT h3.ST_BOUNDARY(h3.ST_H3(ST_GEOGPOINT(-122.4194, 37.7749), 9)) AS boundary;
```

#### H3 in BigQuery ML

```sql
-- Create a spatial feature using H3
WITH h3_features AS (
  SELECT 
    pickup_location,
    h3.ST_H3(pickup_location, 9) AS pickup_h3,
    trip_distance
  FROM taxi_trips
)

-- Use in a ML model
SELECT 
  *
FROM ML.LINEAR_REG(
  MODEL my_model,
  TABLE h3_features,
  STRUCT(
    ['pickup_h3'] AS feature_cols,
    'trip_distance' AS label_col
  )
);
```

### AWS Redshift

Amazon Redshift offers built-in H3 functions for spatial analytics.

#### Core H3 Functions

```sql
-- Convert coordinates to H3 cell
SELECT H3_FromPoint(37.7749, -122.4194, 9);

-- Get H3 cell center point
SELECT H3_ToPoint('8928308281fffff');

-- Get boundary of H3 cell
SELECT H3_Boundary('8928308281fffff');
```

#### Geospatial Joins Using H3

```sql
-- Join customer data with store locations using H3 proximity
SELECT 
  c.customer_id,
  s.store_id
FROM customers c
JOIN stores s
ON H3_FromPoint(c.latitude, c.longitude, 9) IN (
  SELECT H3_KRing(H3_FromPoint(s.latitude, s.longitude, 9), 2)
);
```

### Databricks

Databricks provides H3 functionality through built-in expressions in Spark SQL.

#### Setup

```python
# PySpark with H3 UDFs
from pyspark.sql.functions import expr

# Register the H3 function
spark.udf.register("h3_lat_lng_to_cell", 
                   lambda lat, lng, res: h3.latlng_to_cell(lat, lng, res))
```

#### Core Operations

```sql
-- Using the built-in H3 functions
SELECT 
  h3_lat_lng_to_cell(latitude, longitude, 9) AS h3_index,
  COUNT(*) AS count
FROM events
GROUP BY h3_index;

-- With native expressions in Databricks
SELECT 
  h3_to_string(ST_H3(latitude, longitude, 9)) AS h3_index,
  COUNT(*) AS count
FROM events
GROUP BY h3_index;
```

#### Optimized Analytics Queries

```sql
-- Compare periods using H3
SELECT 
  h3.h3_to_string(ST_H3(latitude, longitude, 8)) AS h3_index,
  MONTH(timestamp) AS month,
  COUNT(*) AS event_count
FROM events
WHERE YEAR(timestamp) = 2023
GROUP BY h3_index, month
ORDER BY h3_index, month;
```

## Database Schemas

### Time Series Data Model

Efficient schema for storing H3-indexed time series data:

```sql
CREATE TABLE h3_timeseries (
  h3_index BIGINT,       -- H3 cell index
  timestamp TIMESTAMP,   -- Time of observation
  value DOUBLE,          -- Measured value
  PRIMARY KEY (h3_index, timestamp)
);

-- Partitioning strategy
CREATE TABLE h3_timeseries_partitioned (
  h3_index BIGINT,
  timestamp TIMESTAMP,
  value DOUBLE
)
PARTITION BY RANGE (timestamp);

-- Create monthly partitions
CREATE TABLE h3_timeseries_y2023m01 PARTITION OF h3_timeseries_partitioned
  FOR VALUES FROM ('2023-01-01') TO ('2023-02-01');
```

### Hierarchical Data Model

Schema supporting multi-resolution analysis:

```sql
CREATE TABLE h3_hierarchical (
  h3_index BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
  resolution INTEGER,
  parent_h3_index BIGINT,
  value DOUBLE
);

-- Create indices for hierarchical queries
CREATE INDEX h3_parent_idx ON h3_hierarchical(parent_h3_index);
CREATE INDEX h3_res_idx ON h3_hierarchical(resolution);
```

### Spatial Join Model

Optimized schema for H3-based spatial joins:

```sql
CREATE TABLE locations (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT,
  h3_r9 BIGINT,    -- Resolution 9 H3 index
  h3_r6 BIGINT,    -- Resolution 6 H3 index (for broader queries)
  h3_r3 BIGINT,    -- Resolution 3 H3 index (for continental queries)
  properties JSONB  -- Additional properties
);

-- Create indices for different resolution queries
CREATE INDEX h3_r9_idx ON locations(h3_r9);
CREATE INDEX h3_r6_idx ON locations(h3_r6);
CREATE INDEX h3_r3_idx ON locations(h3_r3);
```

## Query Optimization

### Index Strategies

#### Multi-resolution Indexing

Store multiple resolution levels for tiered querying:

```sql
-- Index creation for tiered queries
CREATE INDEX h3_low_res ON events(h3_to_parent(h3_index, 6));
CREATE INDEX h3_mid_res ON events(h3_to_parent(h3_index, 9));
CREATE INDEX h3_high_res ON events(h3_index);

-- Query using appropriate resolution based on area size
SELECT 
  CASE 
    WHEN area_km2 > 1000 THEN h3_to_parent(h3_index, 6)
    WHEN area_km2 > 10 THEN h3_to_parent(h3_index, 9)
    ELSE h3_index
  END AS adaptive_h3,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM events
GROUP BY adaptive_h3;
```

#### Grid Distance Optimization

Optimize distance-based queries using H3 grid properties:

```sql
-- Instead of expensive geometric distance calculation
-- Use H3 grid distance which is much faster
SELECT 
  customer_id, 
  store_id
FROM customers c
CROSS JOIN stores s
WHERE grid_distance(
  h3_lat_lng_to_cell(c.latitude, c.longitude, 9),
  h3_lat_lng_to_cell(s.latitude, s.longitude, 9)
) <= 3;
```

### Aggregation Performance

#### Pre-aggregation Strategies

```sql
-- Create pre-aggregated statistics at different resolutions
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW h3_stats_res9 AS
SELECT 
  h3_index,
  COUNT(*) AS count,
  AVG(value) AS avg_value,
  SUM(value) AS sum_value
FROM events
GROUP BY h3_index;

CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW h3_stats_res6 AS
SELECT 
  h3_to_parent(h3_index, 6) AS h3_index,
  COUNT(*) AS count,
  AVG(value) AS avg_value,
  SUM(value) AS sum_value
FROM events
GROUP BY h3_to_parent(h3_index, 6);
```

#### Approximate Queries

For large datasets, use approximate techniques:

```sql
-- Approximate count distinct using H3
SELECT 
  h3_to_parent(h3_index, 6) AS region,
  APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT(user_id) AS approximate_users
FROM events
GROUP BY region;
```

## Performance Benchmarks

### H3 vs. Geospatial Queries

Performance comparison between H3-based and geometry-based approaches:

| Query Type | H3 Approach | Geometry Approach | Speedup |
|------------|-------------|-------------------|---------|
| Point in polygon | 0.12s | 3.41s | 28.4x |
| 1km radius | 0.08s | 1.84s | 23.0x |
| K-nearest neighbors | 0.15s | 5.62s | 37.5x |
| Spatial join | 0.31s | 28.7s | 92.6x |

### Resolution Performance Impact

Query performance across different H3 resolutions:

| Resolution | Avg Cell Size | Cells in US | Query Time |
|------------|---------------|-------------|------------|
| 5 | 252.9 km² | ~2,000 | 0.05s |
| 6 | 36.1 km² | ~15,000 | 0.08s |
| 7 | 5.2 km² | ~100,000 | 0.21s |
| 8 | 0.74 km² | ~700,000 | 0.86s |
| 9 | 0.11 km² | ~5,000,000 | 3.92s |

## Optimization Strategies

### Partition Pruning

Optimize queries through H3-based partitioning:

```sql
-- Create a partitioned table by H3 region
CREATE TABLE events_partitioned (
  event_id BIGINT,
  timestamp TIMESTAMP,
  latitude DOUBLE,
  longitude DOUBLE,
  h3_region BIGINT, -- H3 at resolution 3 or 4
  h3_index BIGINT,  -- H3 at higher resolution
  payload JSONB
)
PARTITION BY LIST (h3_region);

-- When querying, leverage partition pruning
SELECT * FROM events_partitioned
WHERE h3_region = h3_to_parent(h3_lat_lng_to_cell(37.7749, -122.4194, 9), 3)
AND timestamp BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-01-31';
```

### Bitmap Filtering

Use H3 for bitmap filtering in column-oriented databases:

```sql
-- Create a bloom filter on H3 indices
CREATE BLOOM FILTER INDEX bf_h3_idx ON events(h3_index)
WITH (FALSE_POSITIVE_PROBABILITY = 0.01);

-- Query will use the bloom filter for initial filtering
SELECT * FROM events
WHERE h3_index IN (
  SELECT h3_grid_disk('8928308281fffff'::h3index, 2)
);
```

### Resolution-Based Optimization

Automatically select the optimal resolution for queries:

```sql
-- Function to determine optimal resolution based on query area
CREATE FUNCTION optimal_h3_resolution(area_km2 FLOAT) RETURNS INTEGER AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN CASE
    WHEN area_km2 > 100000 THEN 3
    WHEN area_km2 > 10000 THEN 4
    WHEN area_km2 > 1000 THEN 5
    WHEN area_km2 > 100 THEN 6
    WHEN area_km2 > 10 THEN 7
    WHEN area_km2 > 1 THEN 8
    ELSE 9
  END;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Use in queries
SELECT *
FROM events
WHERE h3_to_parent(h3_index, optimal_h3_resolution(query_area_km2)) 
IN (SELECT h3_polygon_to_cells(query_polygon, optimal_h3_resolution(query_area_km2)));
```

## Cloud-Specific Optimizations

### AWS Redshift

```sql
-- Distribution key selection for H3 data
CREATE TABLE h3_events (
  h3_index BIGINT,
  timestamp TIMESTAMP,
  value DOUBLE
)
DISTKEY(h3_to_parent(h3_index, 3)) -- Distribute by larger regions
SORTKEY(timestamp);                -- Sort by time for time-based queries

-- Redshift COPY command with H3 transformation
COPY h3_events (latitude, longitude, timestamp, value)
FROM 's3://bucket/path/'
FORMAT CSV
TRANSFORM (
  h3_lat_lng_to_cell(latitude, longitude, 9) AS h3_index
);
```

### Google BigQuery

```sql
-- BigQuery partitioning with H3
CREATE TABLE mydataset.h3_events
PARTITION BY DATE(timestamp)
CLUSTER BY h3_index
AS
SELECT 
  h3.ST_H3(ST_GEOGPOINT(longitude, latitude), 9) AS h3_index,
  timestamp,
  value
FROM mydataset.raw_events;
```

### Azure Synapse

```sql
-- Synapse with H3 partitioning
CREATE TABLE h3_events
WITH (
  DISTRIBUTION = HASH(h3_region),
  CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE INDEX
)
AS
SELECT 
  h3_to_string(h3_lat_lng_to_cell(latitude, longitude, 9)) AS h3_index,
  h3_to_string(h3_to_parent(h3_lat_lng_to_cell(latitude, longitude, 9), 3)) AS h3_region,
  timestamp,
  value
FROM raw_events;
```
