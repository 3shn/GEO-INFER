# Spatial Analysis Techniques with H3

This document explores advanced spatial analysis techniques that leverage the unique properties of the H3 geospatial indexing system.

## Core Spatial Operations

### Point Analysis

#### Point to Cell Conversion
The foundation of H3-based analysis is converting geographic points to H3 cells:

```python
import h3

# Convert a latitude/longitude point to an H3 index at resolution 9
lat, lng = 37.7749, -122.4194  # San Francisco
h3_index = h3.latlng_to_cell(lat, lng, 9)  # Returns '8928308281fffff'
```

This operation enables:
- Data aggregation to hexagonal cells
- Uniform spatial binning
- Consistent analysis across varied data sources

#### Cell Statistics
Retrieving geometric properties of cells:

```python
# Get the area of a cell in square kilometers
area_km2 = h3.cell_area(h3_index, 'km^2')

# Get the edge length of a cell in meters
edge_length_m = h3.edge_length(h3_index, 'm')

# Get the center coordinates of a cell
center_coords = h3.cell_to_latlng(h3_index)  # Returns (lat, lng)
```

### Proximity Analysis

#### K-Ring Neighbors
Finding cells within a specified grid distance:

```python
# Get all cells within 2 grid steps (hexagonal distance)
neighboring_indices = h3.grid_disk(h3_index, 2)
```

K-ring operations create concentric rings of hexagons around a central cell, useful for:
- Proximity buffers
- Service area analysis
- Signal propagation modeling

#### Distance Calculation
Determining grid distance between cells:

```python
# Calculate the grid distance between two H3 indices
h3_index1 = h3.latlng_to_cell(37.7749, -122.4194, 9)
h3_index2 = h3.latlng_to_cell(37.3382, -121.8863, 9)
distance = h3.grid_distance(h3_index1, h3_index2)  # Returns grid steps
```

H3 grid distance provides:
- Consistent topological distance regardless of cell size
- O(1) distance calculation compared to geodesic calculations
- Natural measure for network analysis

### Polygon Operations

#### Polyfill
Converting arbitrary polygons to sets of H3 cells:

```python
# Convert a GeoJSON polygon to a set of H3 indices
polygon = {
    'type': 'Polygon',
    'coordinates': [
        [
            [-122.4089, 37.8036],
            [-122.4089, 37.7096],
            [-122.3599, 37.7096],
            [-122.3599, 37.8036],
            [-122.4089, 37.8036]
        ]
    ]
}

# Fill the polygon with resolution 9 hexagons
h3_indices = h3.polygon_to_cells(polygon, 9)
```

Polyfill enables:
- Conversion between vector and discrete H3 representations
- Efficient spatial indexing of complex shapes
- Parallelization of polygon operations

#### Union and Intersection
Set operations on H3 cell collections:

```python
# Union of two sets of H3 indices
union_set = set(h3_indices1) | set(h3_indices2)

# Intersection of two sets of H3 indices
intersection_set = set(h3_indices1) & set(h3_indices2)
```

These operations facilitate:
- Spatial overlays and joins
- Coverage analysis
- Complex spatial queries

## Advanced Analytical Techniques

### Multi-resolution Analysis

#### Hierarchical Aggregation
Analyzing data across different scales:

```python
# Aggregate from resolution 9 to resolution 6
resolution_9_indices = {...}  # Set of resolution 9 indices
resolution_6_indices = {h3.cell_to_parent(idx, 6) for idx in resolution_9_indices}

# Count cells per parent
from collections import Counter
parent_counts = Counter(h3.cell_to_parent(idx, 6) for idx in resolution_9_indices)
```

This approach enables:
- Multi-scale pattern detection
- Data summarization
- Dynamic level-of-detail visualization

#### Compaction
Optimizing representation of contiguous regions:

```python
# Compact a set of H3 indices to their optimal representation
h3_indices = {...}  # Set of indices at mixed resolutions
compact_cellsed = h3.compact_cells_cells(h3_indices)

# Uncompact_cells back to a specific resolution
uncompact_cells_cellsed = h3.uncompact_cells_cells_cells(compact_cellsed, 9)
```

Compaction reduces cell counts by:
- Replacing clusters of child cells with their parent
- Maintaining coverage while minimizing cell count
- Enabling efficient storage and processing

### Spatial Statistics

#### Density Analysis
Calculating spatial density metrics:

```python
# Create a density map from point data
points = [(lat1, lng1), (lat2, lng2), ...]  # List of coordinates
h3_counts = Counter(h3.latlng_to_cell(lat, lng, 9) for lat, lng in points)

# Normalize by cell area
h3_density = {idx: count / h3.cell_area(idx, 'km^2') for idx, count in h3_counts.items()}
```

This approach provides:
- Normalized density metrics
- Consistent comparison across regions
- Foundation for hotspot detection

#### Spatial Smoothing
Applying convolution to H3 grid data:

```python
# Apply a simple smoothing kernel to H3 data
def smooth_h3_data(h3_values, k=1):
    """Apply a spatial smoothing kernel to H3 values."""
    result = {}
    for idx, value in h3_values.items():
        neighbors = h3.grid_disk(idx, k)
        neighbor_values = [h3_values.get(n, 0) for n in neighbors]
        result[idx] = sum(neighbor_values) / len(neighbors)
    return result
```

Spatial smoothing is useful for:
- Noise reduction
- Trend surface analysis
- Filling data gaps

### Movement Analysis

#### Origin-Destination Analysis
Analyzing flows between hexagons:

```python
# Create an origin-destination matrix
od_flows = {}
for origin_idx, dest_idx in movement_data:
    od_pair = (origin_idx, dest_idx)
    od_flows[od_pair] = od_flows.get(od_pair, 0) + 1
```

This facilitates:
- Movement pattern detection
- Flow visualization
- Transportation analysis

#### Path Analysis
Analyzing routes using H3:

```python
# Find the shortest path between two H3 indices
origin = h3.latlng_to_cell(start_lat, start_lng, 9)
destination = h3.latlng_to_cell(end_lat, end_lng, 9)
path = h3.grid_path_cells(origin, destination)  # Returns indices along the line
```

H3 paths enable:
- Network analysis without explicit graph data
- Consistent routing on the hexagonal grid
- Efficient corridor analysis

## Integration with Other Systems

### GIS Integration

```python
# Convert H3 cells to GeoJSON for GIS visualization
def h3_set_to_geojson(h3_indices):
    features = []
    for idx in h3_indices:
        polygon = h3.cell_to_latlng_boundary(idx, geo_json=True)
        feature = {
            "type": "Feature",
            "properties": {"h3": idx},
            "geometry": {
                "type": "Polygon",
                "coordinates": [polygon]
            }
        }
        features.append(feature)
    
    return {
        "type": "FeatureCollection",
        "features": features
    }
```

### Machine Learning Features

Creating spatial features for ML models:

```python
# Generate spatial features based on H3 neighbors
def generate_h3_features(h3_index, data_dict):
    """Generate features for a cell based on its neighborhood."""
    features = []
    # Cell's own value
    features.append(data_dict.get(h3_index, 0))
    
    # First-ring neighbor values
    ring1 = h3.grid_disk(h3_index, 1) - {h3_index}
    features.extend([data_dict.get(n, 0) for n in sorted(ring1)])
    
    # Second-ring neighbor values
    ring2 = h3.grid_disk(h3_index, 2) - h3.grid_disk(h3_index, 1)
    ring2_avg = sum(data_dict.get(n, 0) for n in ring2) / len(ring2) if ring2 else 0
    features.append(ring2_avg)
    
    return features
```

This approach enables:
- Spatial context features for ML models
- Consistent feature engineering across geographic regions
- Capturing multi-scale spatial patterns

## Performance Considerations

### Resolution Selection
Choosing appropriate resolutions for different analyses:

| Analysis Type | Recommended Resolution | Approximate Cell Size |
|---------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| Continental   | 2-3                    | 80-160 km            |
| Country       | 4-5                    | 8-20 km              |
| Metropolitan  | 7-8                    | 0.5-1.2 km           |
| Neighborhood  | 9-10                   | 60-170 m             |
| Building      | 12-13                  | 3-10 m               |

### Cell Count Estimation
Estimating the number of cells for an analysis:

```python
# Estimate cell count for a bounding box
def estimate_cell_count(north, south, east, west, resolution):
    # Calculate the approximate area in square kilometers
    height = haversine_distance(north, west, south, west)
    width = haversine_distance(north, west, north, east)
    area_km2 = height * width
    
    # Get average hexagon area at this resolution
    hex_area_km2 = h3.hex_area(resolution, 'km^2')
    
    # Estimate count (with 10% buffer for edge effects)
    return int(area_km2 / hex_area_km2 * 1.1)
```

### Memory Optimization
For large-scale analysis:

- Use compact_cells indices where possible
- Consider using bit-packed representations
- Leverage spatial locality for caching
- Process data incrementally by H3 region
