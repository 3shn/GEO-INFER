# Temporal Dimensions in Geospatial Data

Time is a fundamental dimension in geospatial data and analysis, adding depth and complexity to our understanding of geographic phenomena. Incorporating temporal aspects allows us to model, analyze, and visualize how spatial patterns and relationships change over time, from milliseconds to millennia.

## Conceptualizing Space-Time

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Space-Time Concepts] --> B[Space]
    A --> C[Time]
    A --> D[Space-Time]
    B --> E[Position/Location]
    B --> F[Spatial Relationships]
    C --> G[Temporal Granularity]
    C --> H[Time Intervals]
    C --> I[Temporal Reference Systems]
    D --> J[Spatiotemporal Patterns]
    D --> K[Event Sequences]
    D --> L[Trajectories]
```

### Space-Time Frameworks

1. **Hägerstrand's Time Geography**
   - Represents individual movements through space and time
   - Key concepts: Space-time path, prism, station, bundle
   - Visualized as space-time cubes where vertical axis represents time

2. **Sinton's Framework**
   - Categorizes components as fixed, controlled, or measured
   - In spatiotemporal analysis, time can be any of these roles:
     - Fixed time, measure space (traditional maps)
     - Fixed space, measure time (site chronology)
     - Control both time and space (animation)

3. **Peuquet's Triad Framework**
   - Integrates three perspectives: what, where, and when
   - WHEN + WHERE → WHAT: What exists at a given location and time?
   - WHEN + WHAT → WHERE: Where is a given object at a specified time?
   - WHERE + WHAT → WHEN: When was a given object at a specific location?

## Temporal Aspects of Geospatial Data

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Temporal Aspects] --> B[Temporal Primitives]
    A --> C[Temporal Resolution]
    A --> D[Temporal Reference Systems]
    A --> E[Temporal Relationships]
    A --> F[Temporal Uncertainty]
    B --> G[Instant/Moment]
    B --> H[Interval/Period]
    B --> I[Span/Duration]
    C --> J[Observation Frequency]
    C --> K[Temporal Granularity]
    D --> L[Calendars]
    D --> M[Linear Time]
    D --> N[Cyclic Time]
    E --> O[Allen's Temporal Relations]
    F --> P[Temporal Accuracy]
    F --> Q[Dating Uncertainty]
```

### Temporal Primitives

1. **Instant/Moment**
   - A point in time with no duration (theoretically)
   - Example: Timestamp of an earthquake event (2023-06-15T14:30:45Z)

2. **Interval/Period**
   - Time between two instants with a beginning and end
   - Example: Duration of a flood event (2023-03-10 to 2023-03-15)

3. **Span/Duration**
   - Length of time without specific anchoring
   - Example: A 30-minute rainfall event (without specifying when it occurred)

### Temporal Reference Systems

1. **Calendars and Clocks**
   - Gregorian calendar, Julian day, Unix time
   - International standards: ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ)

2. **Linear vs. Cyclic Time**
   - Linear: Continuous progression (historical events)
   - Cyclic: Recurring patterns (seasons, daily cycles, tides)

3. **Specialized Temporal References**
   - Geological time scale
   - Archaeological periods
   - Fiscal years, academic semesters

### Allen's Temporal Relations

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Allen's Temporal Relations] --> B[Equal]
    A --> C[Before/After]
    A --> D[Meets/Is Met By]
    A --> E[Overlaps/Is Overlapped By]
    A --> F[During/Contains]
    A --> G[Starts/Is Started By]
    A --> H[Finishes/Is Finished By]
```

These 13 basic relations describe all possible relationships between time intervals:
- **Equal**: Intervals have same start and end times
- **Before/After**: One interval completely precedes another
- **Meets/Is Met By**: End of one interval coincides with start of another
- **Overlaps/Is Overlapped By**: Intervals overlap partially
- **During/Contains**: One interval falls completely within another
- **Starts/Is Started By**: Intervals start together but end differently
- **Finishes/Is Finished By**: Intervals end together but start differently

## Types of Temporal Geospatial Data

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Temporal Geospatial Data] --> B[Snapshot]
    A --> C[Time-Stamped]
    A --> D[Space-Time Composite]
    A --> E[Spatiotemporal Object]
    A --> F[Event-Based]
    B --> G[Discrete States]
    C --> H[Feature Changes]
    D --> I[Change History]
    E --> J[Moving Objects]
    F --> K[Discrete Occurrences]
```

### Snapshot Model

- Series of complete spatial datasets at different time points
- Each snapshot represents state of entire study area at a specific time
- Simple but often storage-intensive
- Example: Land cover maps from different years

### Time-Stamped/Base State with Amendments

- Initial base state plus recorded changes
- Timestamps associated with features or attributes
- Efficient for sparse temporal changes
- Example: Parcel database with transaction dates

### Space-Time Composite

- Features split whenever any attribute changes
- Each unit has consistent history
- Efficient for analyzing change
- Example: Administrative boundaries with valid time periods

### Spatiotemporal Object/Moving Object

- Objects with continuously changing spatial properties
- Often represented as trajectories or functions
- Example: GPS tracks of vehicles, animal movements

### Event-Based Model

- Discrete occurrences with location and time
- Often point-based with attributes
- Example: Crime incidents, disease outbreaks, earthquakes

## Temporal Resolution and Sampling

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Temporal Resolution] --> B[High Resolution]
    A --> C[Medium Resolution]
    A --> D[Low Resolution]
    B --> E[Real-time/Near-real-time]
    B --> F[Sub-daily]
    C --> G[Daily]
    C --> H[Weekly/Monthly]
    D --> I[Annual]
    D --> J[Decadal/Century]
```

### Temporal Resolution Considerations

1. **Phenomenon Rate of Change**
   - Match resolution to speed of change
   - Fast processes (weather): Minutes to hours
   - Medium processes (vegetation growth): Days to months
   - Slow processes (geomorphology): Years to centuries

2. **Nyquist Frequency Principle**
   - Sampling rate must be at least twice the highest frequency component
   - Prevents temporal aliasing (misrepresenting change patterns)

3. **Regular vs. Irregular Sampling**
   - Regular: Fixed time intervals
   - Irregular: Event-driven or opportunistic
   - Trade-offs between consistency and information value

## Spatiotemporal Analysis Techniques

- **From-To Change Analysis**: Transition between states
- **Continuous Change Variables**: Quantifying amount of change

### Temporal Trend Analysis

Analyzing patterns over time:
- **Simple Trends**: Linear, exponential, seasonal
- **Breakpoint Detection**: Identifying when significant changes occur
- **Spatial Variation of Temporal Trends**: Where is change happening fastest?

### Movement Analysis

Studying objects that change position:
- **Trajectory Mining**: Extracting patterns from movement data
- **Flow Analysis**: Aggregate movements between locations
- **Origin-Destination Analysis**: Understanding movement patterns

### Spatiotemporal Pattern Discovery

Finding patterns in both space and time:
- **Spatiotemporal Clustering**: Grouping similar events in space and time
- **Emerging Hot Spots**: Areas becoming more active
- **Spatiotemporal Autocorrelation**: How patterns of similarity evolve

### Process-Based Models

Simulating systems with temporal dynamics:
- **Cellular Automata**: Grid-based models with transition rules
- **Agent-Based Models**: Simulating individual entity behaviors
- **System Dynamics**: Modeling feedback loops and stocks/flows

plt.plot(ts.index, rolling_avg, 'b-', label='12-month Rolling Average')
plt.plot(ts.index, trend_line, 'r--', label=f'Trend (slope={slope:.4f})')
plt.title('NDVI Trend Analysis')
plt.ylabel('NDVI Value')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True, alpha=0.3)
plt.savefig('ndvi_trend.png')

# Calculate change between first and last year
first_year = ts[ts.index.year == ts.index.year[0]].mean()
last_year = ts[ts.index.year == ts.index.year[-1]].mean()
percent_change = ((last_year - first_year) / first_year) * 100

print(f"Change from {ts.index.year[0]} to {ts.index.year[-1]}: {percent_change:.2f}%")

# Create a simple anomaly detection
# Calculate the z-score for each month
mean_ndvi = ts.mean()
std_ndvi = ts.std()
z_scores = (ts - mean_ndvi) / std_ndvi

# Identify anomalies (z-score > 2 or < -2)
anomalies = ts[abs(z_scores) > 2]

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.plot(ts.index, ts.values, 'g-', label='NDVI')
plt.scatter(anomalies.index, anomalies.values, color='red', s=50, label='Anomalies')
