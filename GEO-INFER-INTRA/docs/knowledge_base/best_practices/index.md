## Featured Best Practices

### Data Management

- **Use Standardized Directory Structures** - Organize your geospatial data using consistent directory structures to improve discoverability and management.
- **Implement Metadata Standards** - Always include complete metadata with your geospatial datasets following standards like ISO 19115 or FGDC.
- **Version Control for Geospatial Data** - Track changes to your geospatial data using version control systems designed for spatial data.

### Data Quality

- **Validate Coordinate Reference Systems** - Always validate and document the coordinate reference system of your datasets.
- **Check for Topological Errors** - Regularly check vector data for topological errors such as overlaps, gaps, and self-intersections.
- **Implement Data Validation Workflows** - Create automated workflows for validating incoming geospatial data.

### Performance Optimization

- **Optimize Raster Storage Formats** - Choose appropriate raster formats and compression methods based on access patterns.
- **Use Spatial Indexing** - Implement spatial indexes for large vector datasets to improve query performance.
- **Implement Multi-level Caching** - Design caching strategies for frequently accessed geospatial data.

### Workflow Design

- **Design for Reproducibility** - Create workflows that are fully documented and reproducible.
- **Parameterize Workflows** - Design workflows with clearly defined parameters that can be modified without changing the workflow structure.
- **Implement Error Handling** - Add robust error handling to workflows to manage common geospatial processing issues.
