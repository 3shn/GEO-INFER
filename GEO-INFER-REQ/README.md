# GEO-INFER-REQ

Requirements engineering using the Properties, Processes, and Perspectives Inter-Framework (P3IF).

## Overview

The GEO-INFER-REQ module is dedicated to systematic requirements engineering for the GEO-INFER framework and its constituent modules, as well as for projects utilizing GEO-INFER. It employs the **Properties, Processes, and Perspectives Inter-Framework (P3IF)** as its core methodology. P3IF provides a structured approach to elicit, analyze, specify, validate, and manage requirements by considering multiple viewpoints and their interplay. This module is crucial for ensuring that GEO-INFER effectively meets the needs of its diverse users and stakeholders, maintains internal consistency, and can adapt to evolving demands in the complex geospatial domain.

## Core Concepts of P3IF

The P3IF methodology revolves around three core pillars:

-   **Properties:** These are the observable characteristics, qualities, or attributes that a system or its components must exhibit. Properties can be functional (what the system does) or non-functional (how well it does it, e.g., performance, security, usability). In GEO-INFER, properties might relate to spatial accuracy, processing speed, data model integrity, or API responsiveness.
-   **Processes:** These are sequences of actions, operations, or transformations that the system performs or supports. Processes describe the dynamic behavior of the system, including data flows, workflows, and interactions between components or with users. Examples in GEO-INFER include ETL pipelines, spatial analysis workflows, or agent decision-making cycles.
-   **Perspectives:** These represent the different viewpoints or standpoints from which requirements are considered. Perspectives can come from various stakeholders (users, developers, domain experts, project managers, governance bodies) or can relate to different concerns (e.g., security, ethics, operational, developmental). Each perspective may prioritize different properties and processes.

**Inter-Framework:** The "Inter-Framework" aspect of P3IF emphasizes its role in bridging and harmonizing requirements across different modules, domains, and even potentially disparate existing frameworks that GEO-INFER might integrate with.

## Key Features of GEO-INFER-REQ

### 1. P3IF Implementation & Tooling
-   **Description:** Provides tools, templates, and defined procedures for applying the P3IF methodology throughout the requirements lifecycle for GEO-INFER modules and projects.
-   **Components:** Requirements elicitation worksheets (based on P3), traceability matrix templates, validation checklists, a structured requirements database schema.
-   **Benefits:** Consistent and rigorous requirements engineering, improved clarity and completeness of specifications.

### 2. Modular Abstraction & Inter-Framework Mapping
-   **Description:** Defines interfaces and abstraction layers for requirements, allowing modules to specify their needs and capabilities in a standardized way. Facilitates mapping requirements between different GEO-INFER modules and potentially to external standards or frameworks (e.g., OGC standards, FAIR principles).
-   **Benefits:** Enhanced interoperability, easier integration of new modules, clear dependency management based on fulfilled/required properties and processes.

### 3. Multiplexing Factors Across Domains
-   **Description:** A system for identifying, categorizing, and managing "multiplexing factors" – common requirements or constraints (e.g., security levels, data privacy Tiers, performance benchmarks, ethical guidelines) that apply across multiple domains or modules but may have different specific instantiations.
-   **Example:** A "Data Sensitivity Level" factor could be applied to GEO-INFER-DATA, GEO-INFER-SEC, and GEO-INFER-APP, each interpreting it according to their specific context but adhering to a common definition.
-   **Benefits:** Consistent application of cross-cutting concerns, reduced redundancy in specifying common requirements, easier impact analysis of changes to these factors.

### 4. Harmonization of Vocabularies & Narratives
-   **Description:** Works in conjunction with GEO-INFER-INTRA (Ontology) to establish and enforce a consistent vocabulary for describing requirements. It also ensures that user stories, use cases, and other requirement narratives are clear, unambiguous, and aligned across different perspectives.
-   **連携:** GEO-INFER-INTRA.
-   **Benefits:** Improved communication among stakeholders, reduced misunderstandings, a shared understanding of system goals.

### 5. Expanded Security Considerations in Requirements
-   **Description:** Places a strong emphasis on integrating security requirements from the earliest stages of development (Security by Design). This involves systematically considering security properties, secure processes, and threat perspectives (e.g., attacker perspective) within the P3IF framework.
-   **連携:** GEO-INFER-SEC.
-   **Benefits:** Proactive identification and mitigation of security risks, more robust and resilient systems.

1.  **Elicitation:** Gathering raw requirements (desired properties and processes) from various stakeholder perspectives.
2.  **Analysis & Negotiation:** Clarifying, decomposing, and refining requirements. Identifying conflicts and negotiating resolutions among stakeholders. Prioritizing requirements.
3.  **Specification:** Documenting the agreed-upon requirements in a clear, concise, and unambiguous manner (e.g., using standardized templates, user stories, formal models).
4.  **Validation:** Ensuring that the specified requirements accurately reflect stakeholder needs and are feasible, testable, and complete.
5.  **Management & Traceability:** Maintaining a baseline of requirements, managing changes, and tracking the relationships between requirements, design elements, code, and tests throughout the lifecycle.

## Integration with other GEO-INFER Modules

-   **GEO-INFER-INTRA (Ontology & Documentation):** REQ relies on INTRA for a common ontology and vocabulary. INTRA documents the outputs of the REQ process (e.g., requirements specifications).
-   **GEO-INFER-SEC (Security):** REQ explicitly incorporates security perspectives and properties into the requirements, which are then implemented and verified by SEC.
-   **GEO-INFER-NORMS (Norms & Compliance):** Compliance requirements (e.g., legal, ethical, standards) are treated as specific stakeholder perspectives and properties within REQ.
-   **GEO-INFER-OPS (Operations):** Operational requirements (e.g., deployability, maintainability, monitoring) are elicited from an operational perspective and fed into the design and development of all modules.
-   **All other GEO-INFER Modules:** Each module is a subject of the REQ process, having its requirements defined using P3IF. REQ also helps define the interfaces and interaction contracts between modules based on their required and provided properties/processes.
-   **GEO-INFER-APP (Applications):** User-facing application requirements are a key input, particularly from the user perspective, focusing on usability, functionality, and user experience properties and processes.

## Use Cases

    *   **REQ Action:** Applying the P3IF workflow to elicit, analyze, specify, validate, and manage requirements for a new module (e.g., GEO-INFER-HYDRO for hydrological modeling), considering perspectives from hydrologists, software developers, and potential users.
2.  **Harmonizing Data Format Requirements Across Modules:**
    *   **REQ Action:** Using the "Multiplexing Factors" feature to define a common requirement for geospatial data format compatibility (e.g., "Must support GeoPackage and Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF") that applies to GEO-INFER-DATA, GEO-INFER-SPACE, GEO-INFER-AI, etc.
3.  **Incorporating New Security Standards:**
    *   **REQ Action:** Updating the security perspective within P3IF to reflect a new security standard (e.g., ISO 27001 controls), analyzing its impact on existing requirements, and propagating changes to relevant modules.
4.  **Validating User Interface Requirements for GEO-INFER-APP:**
    *   **REQ Action:** Conducting validation sessions (e.g., usability testing, prototype reviews) with target users to confirm that the specified UI/UX properties and processes for a new GEO-INFER-APP feature meet their needs.
5.  **Managing a Change Request for an Existing Feature:**
    *   **REQ Action:** Using the requirements database and traceability links to analyze the impact of a requested change on other requirements, system components, and tests before approving and implementing it.
