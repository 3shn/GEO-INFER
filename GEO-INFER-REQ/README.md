# GEO-INFER-REQ

**Geospatial Requirements Engineering, User Stories, and Specification Management**

## Overview

GEO-INFER-REQ is a specialized module for managing the entire lifecycle of requirements for geospatial systems and applications. It provides tools, methodologies, and workflows for capturing, analyzing, specifying, validating, and tracking requirements with a focus on the unique challenges of geospatial contexts. This module bridges the gap between stakeholder needs and technical implementation, ensuring that geospatial systems are built according to well-defined, consistent, and traceable requirements. GEO-INFER-REQ emphasizes the importance of accurately capturing spatial elements in requirements specifications and supports systematic approaches to managing changing requirements throughout project lifecycles.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Familiarity with requirements engineering concepts

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the GEO-INFER repository if you haven't already
# git clone https://github.com/activeinference/GEO-INFER.git
# cd GEO-INFER

# Install the REQ module
pip install -e ./GEO-INFER-REQ

### Basic Usage Examples

**1. Creating a Geospatial User Story**
```python
from geo_infer_req.specification import GeospatialUserStory

# Create a user story with explicit spatial components
story = GeospatialUserStory(
    role="Emergency Response Planner",
    action="view predicted flood extents",
    benefit="prioritize evacuation zones",
    spatial_context={
        "area_of_interest": "Riverside County",
        "spatial_resolution": "neighborhood level",
        "spatial_accuracy": "within 50 meters"
    }
)

# Add acceptance criteria
story.add_acceptance_criteria([
    "Flood extents are visualized on an interactive map",
    "Each flood zone shows estimated time of inundation",
    "Zones can be filtered by predicted water depth",
    "Population data is overlaid on flood zones"
])

# Add spatial constraints
story.add_spatial_constraints([
    "System must account for levee infrastructure",
    "Predictions must incorporate digital elevation model data",
    "Analysis must consider storm drain capacity"
])

# Export to various formats
story.export_to_markdown("stories/flood_response_story.md")
story.export_to_jira()
```

**2. Establishing Traceability for Spatial Requirements**
```python
from geo_infer_req.traceability import RequirementsTraceabilityMatrix
from geo_infer_req.specification import import_requirements

# Import requirements from various sources
spatial_requirements = import_requirements("docs/spatial_requirements.xlsx")
functional_requirements = import_requirements("docs/functional_requirements.json")

# Create a traceability matrix
matrix = RequirementsTraceabilityMatrix()

# Add requirements to the matrix
for req in spatial_requirements + functional_requirements:
    matrix.add_requirement(req)

# Link requirements to design components
matrix.link_requirement_to_design("REQ-SPATIAL-001", "DesignComponent", "SpatialDataModel")
matrix.link_requirement_to_design("REQ-FUNC-103", "DesignComponent", "QueryProcessor")

# Link requirements to code implementations
matrix.link_requirement_to_code("REQ-SPATIAL-001", "GitHub", "geo_infer_space/core/data_model.py")

# Link requirements to test cases
matrix.link_requirement_to_test("REQ-SPATIAL-001", "TestCase", "test_spatial_data_model.py")

# Generate traceability reports
matrix.generate_report("docs/traceability/requirements_coverage.html")
matrix.generate_impact_analysis("REQ-SPATIAL-001", "docs/change_impact_analysis.html")
```

**3. Validating Spatial Requirements**
```python
from geo_infer_req.validation import SpatialRequirementValidator
import geopandas as gpd

# Load the requirements to validate
requirements = import_requirements("docs/spatial_requirements.xlsx")

# Initialize the validator
validator = SpatialRequirementValidator(requirements)

# Check for common issues in spatial requirements
validation_results = validator.validate()

# Review the results
for result in validation_results:
    if result.severity == "critical":
        print(f"CRITICAL: Requirement {result.req_id}: {result.message}")
    elif result.severity == "warning":
        print(f"WARNING: Requirement {result.req_id}: {result.message}")

# Validate against real-world geography
study_area = gpd.read_file("data/study_area.geojson")
geographic_validation = validator.validate_against_geography(study_area)

# Generate validation report
validator.generate_report("docs/validation/requirements_validation.html")
```

## Best Practices

### Elicitation
- Involve diverse stakeholders, especially those with geospatial domain knowledge
- Use map-based elicitation techniques for spatial requirements
- Document spatial assumptions explicitly
- Clarify spatial accuracy and resolution requirements early

### Specification
- Be explicit about spatial contexts and constraints
- Include maps, diagrams, or visual references where helpful
- Specify non-functional requirements for spatial performance
- Document relationships between spatial and non-spatial requirements

### Validation
- Prototype spatial interfaces early to validate understanding
- Use real geographic data in validation exercises
- Test requirements with different stakeholder perspectives
- Validate both technical correctness and user value

## Future Development

- Advanced natural language processing for requirements analysis
