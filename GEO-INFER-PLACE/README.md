# GEO-INFER-PLACE

**Deep Place-Based Geospatial Analysis Framework**

## Overview

GEO-INFER-PLACE provides comprehensive, location-specific geospatial analysis capabilities within the GEO-INFER framework. Unlike the general examples in GEO-INFER-EXAMPLES, this module enables deep, intensive analysis of specific geographic locations with rich contextual understanding, multi-temporal studies, and cross-domain integration tailored to unique regional characteristics and challenges.

This module serves as a dedicated space for developing place-based expertise, conducting longitudinal studies, and creating reusable analysis templates for specific geographic regions. Each location maintains its own data ecosystem, analytical workflows, and knowledge base while leveraging the full power of the GEO-INFER framework.

## Role in GEO-INFER Framework

GEO-INFER-PLACE is dedicated to **place-specific analysis and workflows**, building upon the general spatial capabilities provided by GEO-INFER-SPACE. This module should only implement logic unique to specific locations (e.g., Del Norte County custom analyzers) and must import all general spatial methods, H3 utilities, OSC integrations, and data integration functions from SPACE.

Key Guidelines:
- **No Duplication**: Do not implement general spatial operations, H3 functions, or data integration here; import from SPACE.
- **Place-Oriented Focus**: Emphasize location-specific data sources, custom analyzers, and regional workflows.
- **Dependency on SPACE**: All spatial processing must route through SPACE for consistency and modularity.

This separation ensures PLACE remains focused on unique geographic contexts while leveraging the robust, tested spatial engine in SPACE.
