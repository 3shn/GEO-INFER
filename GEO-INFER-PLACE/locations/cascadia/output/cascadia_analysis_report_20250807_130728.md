# Cascadia Agricultural Land Analysis Report
*Generated: 2025-08-07 13:07:28*

## 1. Executive Summary
This report presents a comprehensive agricultural land analysis for the **Cascadia** bioregion, encompassing northern California and all of Oregon.
The analysis utilized H3 spatial indexing at resolution **8** to integrate and assess data from **4 specialized modules**. The key output is a redevelopment potential score for each hexagonal area, identifying promising locations for agricultural transition.

## 2. Analysis Overview
- **Total Hexagons Analyzed:** 7,749
- **H3 Resolution:** 8
- **Modules Executed:** `zoning, current_use, ownership, improvements`

## 3. Redevelopment Potential Insights
- **Mean Redevelopment Score:** 0.186
- **Median Redevelopment Score:** 0.162
- **High Potential Areas (>0.75):** 0 hexagons
- **Low Potential Areas (<0.25):** 7,718 hexagons

## 4. Module Coverage
This section details the data coverage for each analysis module across the target hexagons.

| Module                    | Processed Hexagons | Coverage (%) |
|---------------------------|--------------------|--------------|
| Zoning                    |             2588 |       33.40 |
| Current_Use               |             7749 |      100.00 |
| Ownership                 |             7749 |      100.00 |
| Improvements              |               49 |        0.63 |

## 5. Technical Framework & Methodology
The analysis is built on a **Unified H3 Backend**, which standardizes diverse geospatial datasets into a common hexagonal grid. This enables:

- **Cross-border Analysis**: Seamless integration of California and Oregon data
- **Multi-source Integration**: Harmonization of zoning, water rights, ownership, and infrastructure data
- **Spatial Consistency**: Uniform resolution and coordinate system across all analyses
- **Scalable Processing**: Efficient handling of large geospatial datasets
- **SPACE Integration**: Advanced spatial analysis using GEO-INFER-SPACE capabilities

## 6. Data Sources & Quality
The analysis integrates data from multiple authoritative sources:

- **Zoning Data**: FMMP (California), ORMAP (Oregon)
- **Water Rights**: eWRIMS (California), Oregon WRD
- **Current Use**: NASS CDL, Land IQ
- **Infrastructure**: Building footprints, power transmission lines
- **Ownership**: County parcel records, USDA ERS

## 7. Redevelopment Scoring Methodology
The redevelopment potential score combines multiple factors:

- **Zoning Compatibility** (25%): Agricultural zoning classifications
- **Water Availability** (20%): Surface and groundwater access
- **Infrastructure** (15%): Power, roads, and improvements
- **Ownership Patterns** (15%): Parcel size and ownership concentration
- **Current Use** (15%): Existing agricultural activities
- **Financial Factors** (10%): Mortgage debt and economic indicators

## 8. SPACE Integration Features
This analysis leverages advanced GEO-INFER-SPACE capabilities:

- **H3 Spatial Indexing**: Efficient hexagonal grid processing
- **OSC Integration**: OS-Climate tool integration for standardized geospatial operations
- **Spatial Analysis**: Correlation analysis, hotspot detection, and proximity analysis
- **Enhanced Visualization**: Interactive dashboards with multi-layer overlays
- **Real-time Data Integration**: Dynamic data loading and processing

## 9. Limitations & Considerations
- **Data Availability**: Some modules may have limited data coverage in certain areas
- **Temporal Aspects**: Data represents a snapshot in time; conditions may change
- **Resolution Trade-offs**: H3 resolution 8 provides ~0.46 kmÂ² hexagons
- **Cross-border Harmonization**: Different data standards between states

## 10. Next Steps & Recommendations
Based on the analysis results, recommended next steps include:

1. **Field Validation**: Ground-truth high-potential areas identified by the analysis
2. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Consult with local agricultural communities and landowners
3. **Policy Development**: Develop targeted policies for agricultural redevelopment
4. **Infrastructure Planning**: Coordinate with utility and transportation agencies
5. **Water Rights Assessment**: Detailed analysis of water availability and rights
