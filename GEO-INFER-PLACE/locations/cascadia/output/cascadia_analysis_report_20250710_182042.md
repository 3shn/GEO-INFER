# Cascadia Agricultural Land Analysis Report
*Generated: 2025-07-10 18:20:42*

## 1. Executive Summary
This report presents a comprehensive agricultural land analysis for the **Cascadia** bioregion, encompassing northern California and all of Oregon.
The analysis utilized H3 spatial indexing at resolution **8** to integrate and assess data from **9 specialized modules**. The key output is a redevelopment potential score for each hexagonal area, identifying promising locations for agricultural transition.

## 2. Analysis Overview
- **Total Hexagons Analyzed:** 252
- **H3 Resolution:** 8
- **Modules Executed:** `zoning`, `current_use`, `ownership`, `mortgage_debt`, `improvements`, `surface_water`, `ground_water`, `power_source`, `water_rights`

## 3. Redevelopment Potential Insights
- **Mean Redevelopment Score:** 0.130
- **Median Redevelopment Score:** 0.130
- **High Potential Areas (>0.75):** 0 hexagons
- **Low Potential Areas (<0.25):** 252 hexagons

## 4. Module Coverage
This section details the data coverage for each analysis module across the target hexagons.

| Module                    | Processed Hexagons | Coverage (%) |
|---------------------------|--------------------|--------------|
| Zoning                    | 252                | 100.00       |
| Current Use               | 0                  | 0.00         |
| Ownership                 | 0                  | 0.00         |
| Mortgage Debt             | 0                  | 0.00         |
| Improvements              | 0                  | 0.00         |
| Surface Water             | 252                | 100.00       |
| Ground Water              | 0                  | 0.00         |
| Power Source              | 0                  | 0.00         |
| Water Rights              | 252                | 100.00       |

## 5. Technical Framework & Methodology
The analysis is built on a **Unified H3 Backend**, which standardizes diverse geospatial datasets into a common hexagonal grid. This enables:
- Seamless cross-border (California/Oregon) analysis.
- Efficient spatial queries and data aggregation.
- Scalable processing for large and complex datasets.
- Consistent and comparable reporting units.

Redevelopment potential is calculated as a weighted composite of scores from each module, including zoning, water security, infrastructure, and financial factors.

## 6. Recommendations
1.  **Focus on High-Potential Areas:** Prioritize further investigation and outreach in hexagons with redevelopment scores **> 0.75**.
2.  **Improve Data Gaps:** Address modules with lower coverage by seeking alternative data sources or partnerships.
3.  **Utilize Interactive Dashboard:** Leverage the generated HTML dashboard for detailed, visual exploration of results.
