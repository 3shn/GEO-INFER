## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Core GEO-INFER framework installed
- Cognitive modeling libraries (e.g., PsychoPy, CCMSuite)
- Natural language processing libraries (e.g., SpaCy with geospatial extensions)
- Visualization libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Plotly)

### Installation
```bash
# Ensure the main GEO-INFER repository is cloned
# git clone https://github.com/activeinference/GEO-INFER.git
# cd GEO-INFER

pip install -e ./GEO-INFER-COG
```

### Basic Usage Examples

**1. Analyze Spatial Description Complexity**
```python
from geo_infer_cog.spatial_language import DescriptionAnalyzer

# Example spatial description
description = "The museum is across from the park, about two blocks north of the river."

# Analyze the cognitive complexity of the description
analyzer = DescriptionAnalyzer()
complexity = analyzer.analyze_complexity(description)

print(f"Spatial description complexity score: {complexity.score}")
print(f"Landmarks referenced: {complexity.landmarks}")
print(f"Spatial relations used: {complexity.relations}")
```

**2. Generate Cognitively Optimized Route Instructions**
```python
from geo_infer_cog.navigation import RouteInstructionGenerator
import geopandas as gpd

# Load route geometry
route = gpd.read_file("path/to/route.geojson")

# Generate cognitively optimized instructions
generator = RouteInstructionGenerator(landmark_emphasis=True)
instructions = generator.generate_instructions(
    route_geometry=route.geometry[0],
    landmark_dataset="path/to/landmarks.geojson",
    user_profile="pedestrian"
)

for step in instructions:
    print(f"Step {step.number}: {step.instruction}")
```

**3. Evaluate Map Visualization Cognitive Load**
```python
from geo_infer_cog.perception import MapCognitiveLoadAnalyzer
from PIL import Image

# Load a map image
map_image = Image.open("path/to/map.png")

# Analyze cognitive load
analyzer = MapCognitiveLoadAnalyzer()
assessment = analyzer.analyze(map_image)

print(f"Overall cognitive load: {assessment.overall_score}")
print(f"Visual complexity: {assessment.visual_complexity}")
print(f"Symbol discriminability: {assessment.symbol_discriminability}")
print(f"Color harmony: {assessment.color_harmony}")
