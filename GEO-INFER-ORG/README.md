## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Understanding of project management principles
- Familiarity with community governance concepts
- Knowledge of collaborative workflows and tools

### Implementation
```bash
# No traditional software installation is needed for ORG
# Instead, you might start by exploring the governance templates
cp GEO-INFER-ORG/templates/governance_template.md my_project_governance.md

# Or setting up a community structure
cp GEO-INFER-ORG/templates/community_structure.md my_community_structure.md
```

### Basic Usage Examples

**1. Establishing a Governance Structure**
```python
from geo_infer_org.governance import GovernanceFramework

# Create a new governance framework for a geospatial project
governance = GovernanceFramework(
    name="River Basin Monitoring Initiative",
    scale="regional",
    stakeholders=["government", "research", "community", "industry"]
)

# Configure decision-making approach
governance.set_decision_model(
    model_type="consent-based",
    quorum=0.6,
    veto_rules={"blocking": ["ethical_concerns", "legal_violations"]}
)

# Define roles and responsibilities
governance.add_role(
    name="Technical Coordination",
    responsibilities=["data standards", "technology selection", "quality control"],
    selection_process="election",
    term_length="1 year"
)

# Generate governance documentation
governance.generate_documentation("my_project/governance/")
```

**2. Stakeholder Mapping and Analysis**
```python
from geo_infer_org.stakeholders import SpatialStakeholderMap
import geopandas as gpd

# Load study area boundary
study_area = gpd.read_file("project_data/river_basin_boundary.geojson")

# Create a spatial stakeholder map
stakeholder_map = SpatialStakeholderMap(study_area=study_area)

# Add stakeholder groups with spatial presence
stakeholder_map.add_stakeholder_group(
    name="Riverside Communities",
    geography="project_data/communities.geojson",
    interests=["flood protection", "water quality", "recreation"],
    influence_level=3,  # 1-5 scale
    impact_level=5      # 1-5 scale
)

# Analyze spatial relationships between stakeholders
proximity_analysis = stakeholder_map.analyze_spatial_relationships()

# Generate engagement strategies based on spatial context
engagement_plan = stakeholder_map.generate_engagement_strategy(
    approach="participatory",
    language_considerations=True,
    accessibility_needs=True
)

# Visualize stakeholder map
stakeholder_map.visualize(
    by="influence",
    output_file="stakeholder_map.html"
)
```

**3. Community Health Monitoring**
```python
from geo_infer_org.community import CommunityHealthMonitor
import datetime

# Initialize community health monitoring
monitor = CommunityHealthMonitor(
    community_name="GeoRivers Initiative",
    start_date=datetime.datetime(2023, 1, 1)
)

# Add data sources for community metrics
monitor.add_data_source(
    name="forum_activity",
    source_type="discourse_api",
    config={"url": "https://forum.georivers.org", "api_key": "***"}
)

monitor.add_data_source(
    name="code_contributions",
    source_type="github_api",
    config={"repository": "georivers/monitoring-tools"}
)

# Define health metrics
monitor.define_metric(
    name="contributor_diversity",
    data_sources=["forum_activity", "code_contributions"],
    calculation="geographic_distribution",
    target_value={"min_countries": 10, "max_concentration": 0.3}
)

# Generate community health report
report = monitor.generate_report(
    time_period="last_quarter",
    format="html",
    include_recommendations=True
)

# Output report
with open("community_health_q2_2023.html", "w") as f:
    f.write(report)
```
