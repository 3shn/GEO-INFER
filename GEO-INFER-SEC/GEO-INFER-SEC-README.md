# GEO-INFER-SEC

## Overview
GEO-INFER-SEC provides security and privacy frameworks for sensitive geospatial information within the GEO-INFER framework. This module ensures that geospatial data is collected, processed, shared, and stored in a manner that protects individual privacy, organizational security, and complies with relevant regulations.

## Key Features
- Geospatial data anonymization techniques
- Role-based access control for location data
- Compliance frameworks for international data regulations
- Secure data sharing protocols across jurisdictions

## Getting Started
1. Installation
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

2. Configuration
   ```bash
   cp config/example.yaml config/local.yaml
   # Edit local.yaml with your configuration
   ```

3. Security Auditing
   ```bash
   python -m geo_infer_sec.audit --data-path /path/to/spatial/data
   ```

## Privacy Protection
GEO-INFER-SEC implements various privacy-preserving techniques for geospatial data:
- Location obfuscation
- K-anonymity for spatial datasets
- Differential privacy for aggregate statistics
- Synthetic data generation
- Geographic masking methods
- Privacy-preserving spatial joins

## Security Features
Comprehensive security capabilities include:
- End-to-end encryption for data in transit
- Secure storage for data at rest
- Authentication and authorization frameworks
- API security with rate limiting and token validation
- Intrusion detection and prevention
- Security event monitoring and alerting

## Compliance Frameworks
Support for various regulatory requirements:
- GDPR for European data protection
- CCPA for California consumer privacy
- HIPAA for health-related geospatial data
- National security classifications
- Industry-specific compliance (e.g., utilities, transportation)
- International data sovereignty requirements

## Risk Assessment
Tools for geospatial security risk assessment:
- Vulnerability scanning for spatial databases
- Threat modeling for geospatial applications
- Privacy impact assessment templates
- Risk mitigation planning
- Incident response workflows
- Security training materials

## Integration with Other Modules
GEO-INFER-SEC integrates with:
- GEO-INFER-OPS for secure operations
- GEO-INFER-DATA for secure data management
- GEO-INFER-API for secure API communications
- GEO-INFER-APP for user authentication and authorization
