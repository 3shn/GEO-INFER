# GEO-INFER-SEC

**Security and Privacy Framework for Geospatial Information**

## Overview

GEO-INFER-SEC is the specialized security and privacy module within the GEO-INFER framework dedicated to protecting sensitive geospatial information throughout its lifecycle. It provides a comprehensive suite of tools, techniques, and protocols to ensure that location data is collected, processed, shared, and stored in a manner that safeguards individual privacy, upholds organizational security requirements, and maintains compliance with relevant regulations. This module serves as the foundation for responsible and ethical handling of geospatial information across all other components of the GEO-INFER ecosystem.

By integrating advanced privacy-preserving methodologies with geospatial-specific security controls, GEO-INFER-SEC enables organizations to derive value from location data while mitigating privacy risks and security vulnerabilities. The module is particularly valuable in contexts where sensitive information such as personal movement patterns, critical infrastructure locations, protected health information with spatial dimensions, or proprietary geographic assets must be secured without compromising analytical utility.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Core GEO-INFER framework installed
- GDAL/OGR libraries for geospatial operations
- H3 for hexagonal grid indexing
- Cryptographic libraries (e.g., cryptography, PyNaCl)

### Installation
```bash
uv pip install -e ./GEO-INFER-SEC
```

### Configuration
Security parameters, privacy settings, and compliance configurations are typically managed via YAML files in the `config/` directory.
```bash
# cp config/example_security_config.yaml config/my_security_config.yaml
# # Edit my_security_config.yaml with specific parameters
```

### Basic Usage Examples

#### Anonymizing Geospatial Data

```python
import geopandas as gpd
from geo_infer_sec.core.anonymization import GeospatialAnonymizer

# Load point data
points = gpd.read_file("sensitive_locations.geojson")

# Create anonymizer
anonymizer = GeospatialAnonymizer()

# Apply location perturbation (random noise)
perturbed = anonymizer.location_perturbation(points, epsilon=100.0)  # 100 meter max distance

# Apply spatial k-anonymity
k_anon = anonymizer.spatial_k_anonymity(points, k=5, h3_resolution=9)

# Save anonymized data
perturbed.to_file("perturbed_locations.geojson", driver="GeoJSON")
k_anon.to_file("k_anonymized_locations.geojson", driver="GeoJSON")
```

#### Encrypting Sensitive Data

```python
import geopandas as gpd
from geo_infer_sec.core.encryption import GeospatialEncryption

# Load data
data = gpd.read_file("sensitive_data.geojson")

# Create encryptor with a password
encryptor = GeospatialEncryption.from_password("secure-password")

# Encrypt sensitive columns and geometry
encrypted = encryptor.encrypt_geodataframe(
    data, 
    sensitive_columns=["name", "address", "phone"],
    encrypt_coordinates=True
)

# Save encrypted data
encrypted.to_file("encrypted_data.geojson", driver="GeoJSON")

# Save encryption key for later decryption
with open("encryption_key.bin", "wb") as f:
    f.write(encryptor.get_key())
```

#### Managing Access Control

```python
from geo_infer_sec.core.access_control import (
    GeospatialAccessManager, Role, SpatialPermission
)
from shapely.geometry import Polygon

# Create access manager
manager = GeospatialAccessManager(secret_key="your-secret-key")

# Create a spatial permission (area of NYC)
nyc_area = Polygon([
    (-74.02, 40.70), (-73.92, 40.70),
    (-73.92, 40.80), (-74.02, 40.80)
])
nyc_permission = SpatialPermission(
    name="nyc_access", 
    geometry=nyc_area,
    attributes=["category", "value"]
)

# Create a role with the permission
analyst_role = Role(name="data_analyst")
analyst_role.add_permission(nyc_permission)

# Add role to manager
manager.add_role(analyst_role)

# Assign role to a user
manager.assign_role_to_user("user123", "data_analyst")

# Generate access token
token = manager.generate_token("user123", expiration_hours=24)
print(f"Access token: {token}")

# Check if a user can access a location
has_access = manager.can_access_location("user123", 40.75, -73.98)  # In NYC
print(f"Has access: {has_access}")
```

# Anonymize geospatial data
python -m geo_infer_sec.cli anonymize sensitive_data.geojson anonymized_data.geojson --method k-anonymity --k 5

# Encrypt sensitive data
python -m geo_infer_sec.cli encrypt sensitive_data.geojson encrypted_data.geojson --password "secure-password" --encrypt-geometry

# Check compliance with regulations
python -m geo_infer_sec.cli check-compliance data.geojson --regimes gdpr,ccpa --format html --output-file compliance_report.html

# Generate a risk assessment
python -m geo_infer_sec.cli risk-assessment --format html --output-file risk_report.html
```

## Security Best Practices

When using GEO-INFER-SEC, follow these best practices:

1. **Least privilege principle**: Only provide access to the minimal spatial areas and attributes needed.
2. **Data minimization**: Collect and retain only the necessary geospatial data.
3. **Key management**: Store encryption keys securely, separate from encrypted data.
4. **Regular auditing**: Periodically review access logs and permissions.
5. **Layered security**: Use multiple anonymization techniques for sensitive data.
6. **Privacy by design**: Consider privacy implications early in application design.
