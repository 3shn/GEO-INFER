# GEO-INFER-HEALTH Module

This module focuses on geospatial applications for public health, epidemiology, and healthcare accessibility.

## Purpose

To provide tools and methodologies for analyzing the spatial dimensions of health-related data, supporting decision-making in public health policy, resource allocation, and epidemiological research.

## Key Features

-   **Disease Surveillance & Outbreak Modeling**: Tools for mapping disease clusters, identifying hotspots, and modeling the spread of infectious diseases.
-   **Healthcare Accessibility Analysis**: Methods to assess and visualize access to healthcare facilities, considering travel time, service availability, and demographic factors.
-   **Environmental Health Risk Assessment**: Integration of environmental data (e.g., air quality, water pollution, climate factors) to assess spatial risks to public health.
-   **Spatial Epidemiology**: Techniques for investigating the geographic distribution and determinants of health-related states or events in specified populations.
-   **Health Disparities Mapping**: Visualization and analysis of health inequalities across different geographic areas and population groups.
-   **Integration with Health Data Standards**: Support for common health data formats and interoperability with existing health information systems (e.g., HL7 FHIR where spatially relevant).

## Use Cases

-   Tracking and predicting the spread of epidemics/pandemics.
-   Optimizing the location of new healthcare facilities.
-   Identifying communities vulnerable to environmental health hazards.
-   Analyzing the impact of socio-economic factors on health outcomes at a geographical level.
-   Planning public health interventions and resource allocation.
