## Integration with other GEO-INFER Modules

GEO-INFER-HEALTH functions as an integral part of the wider GEO-INFER ecosystem:

-   **GEO-INFER-DATA:** Essential for accessing, managing, and processing foundational geospatial data (e.g., administrative boundaries, demographics, environmental layers, points of interest) and health-related datasets (e.g., de-identified case data, facility locations). `ETL_HEALTH` components utilize DATA for data ingestion and preparation.
-   **GEO-INFER-SPACE:** Provides the core spatial analysis functions, geometric operations, network analysis, and spatial indexing required for many health analyses (e.g., proximity calculations, catchment area definition, spatial clustering).
-   **GEO-INFER-TIME:** Crucial for analyzing temporal trends in disease incidence, tracking changes in healthcare accessibility over time, or modeling the temporal dynamics of environmental exposures.
-   **GEO-INFER-AI & GEO-INFER-AGENT:** Can be used to develop predictive models for disease outbreaks (AI), or to simulate population behaviors and disease transmission dynamics (AGENT within SIM).
-   **GEO-INFER-SIM:** Provides the environment to run agent-based models or other simulations relevant to health, such as modeling intervention impacts or resource allocation scenarios.
-   **GEO-INFER-RISK:** Can provide data and models on environmental hazards (e.g., flood zones, pollution sources) that are inputs into environmental health risk assessments.
-   **GEO-INFER-SEC:** Critical for ensuring that health data, which is often sensitive, is handled according to privacy regulations, including anonymization of spatial data before analysis or sharing.
-   **GEO-INFER-APP:** Serves as the frontend for visualizing outputs from the HEALTH module, such as interactive maps of disease hotspots, accessibility dashboards, or environmental risk maps.
-   **GEO-INFER-BIO:** May provide insights into pathogen characteristics or population genetics that can inform epidemiological models within HEALTH.
-   **GEO-INFER-SPM:** Offers advanced statistical parametric mapping techniques that can be applied to health data for rigorous spatiotemporal analysis.

## Data Models (Conceptual Examples)

The `GEO-INFER-HEALTH` module would utilize Pydantic models for structuring its data, for example:

-   `DiseaseCaseRecord`: Represents an individual disease case with attributes like location (anonymized or aggregated), date of onset, demographics.
-   `HealthFacility`: Information about a healthcare facility, including location, type, capacity, services offered.
-   `EnvironmentalExposure`: Data linking locations to levels of specific environmental hazards or pollutants over time.
-   `AccessibilityResult`: Output of accessibility analyses, often a GeoDataFrame with scores for different areas.
-   `RiskAssessmentZone`: A geographic area with associated health risk scores based on various factors.

(Detailed schemas would be defined in `src/geo_infer_health/models/data_models.py`)

## Future Development

-   Enhanced integration with real-time health data streams (e.g., syndromic surveillance).
-   Development of more sophisticated predictive models for disease forecasting, incorporating climate and mobility data.
-   Advanced tools for modeling the impact of health interventions and policy changes.
-   Expansion of support for international health data standards and ontologies.
-   Tools for privacy-preserving federated learning on distributed health datasets.
-   Integration of genomic data for phylogeographic analysis of pathogen spread.
