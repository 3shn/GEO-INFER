# GEO-INFER-ANT

## Overview
GEO-INFER-ANT is a specialized module for complex systems modeling using Active Inference principles within the GEO-INFER framework. Named for the emergent properties of ant colonies, this module focuses on multi-scale, distributed agent systems and their collective behaviors in geospatial contexts.

## Key Features
- Movement data integration with spatial-temporal models
- Simulation environments to study colony dynamics in changing ecosystems
- Ant-inspired algorithms for geospatial workflow optimization
- Multi-agent modeling for complex adaptive systems
