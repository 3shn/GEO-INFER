# GEO-INFER-API

**Standardized Interfaces for Geospatial Interoperability**

## Overview

GEO-INFER-API is the **central nervous system for communication and interoperability** within the GEO-INFER framework and with external systems. This module is responsible for designing, developing, and managing standardized, secure, and efficient Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). It serves as a unified gateway, abstracting the complexities of individual modules and providing consistent access to their functionalities and data. By adhering to widely adopted geospatial and web API standards, GEO-INFER-API ensures that different components can communicate effectively, and that external developers and applications can easily integrate with the GEO-INFER ecosystem.

## Core Objectives

-   **Interoperability:** Enable seamless data exchange and functional interaction between all GEO-INFER modules and with external systems using common standards.
-   **Standardization:** Implement and promote the use of OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium) and other relevant API standards (e.g., REST, GraphQL, STAC).
-   **Abstraction:** Provide a simplified and consistent interface to complex underlying functionalities of various GEO-INFER modules.
-   **Security:** Ensure all API interactions are secure through robust authentication, authorization, and data protection mechanisms.
-   **Discoverability & Usability:** Make APIs easily discoverable, well-documented, and straightforward for developers to use, providing client SDKs where appropriate.
-   **Scalability & Performance:** Design APIs that can handle a high volume of requests efficiently and scale with the growth of the GEO-INFER framework.

## Key Features

-   **OGC-Compliant API Development:** Implementation of key OGC API standards (e.g., OGC API Features, Processes, Maps, Tiles, EDR - Environmental Data Retrieval) to ensure interoperability with standard GIS tools and platforms.
-   **Versatile API Paradigms:** Support for multiple API styles including RESTful services (using frameworks like FastAPI) for resource-oriented interactions and GraphQL for flexible and efficient data querying, catering to different client needs.
-   **Webhook & Real-time Event Integration:** Mechanisms for real-time communication, allowing modules or external services to subscribe to events and receive updates via webhooks or WebSocket connections (e.g., for data updates, completed analyses).
-   **Comprehensive API Documentation & SDKs:** Auto-generated, interactive API documentation (e.g., Swagger/OpenAPI, ReDoc) and the provision of client Software Development Kits (SDKs) in popular languages (Python, JavaScript, R) to simplify integration.
-   **API Gateway Functionality:** Acts as a central entry point for API requests, handling routing, rate limiting, request/response transformation, and potentially aggregating services from multiple backend modules.
-   **Security & Access Control:** Robust implementation of authentication (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0, JWT) and authorization (e.g., role-based access control - RBAC) mechanisms, integrated with GEO-INFER-SEC.
-   **Geospatial Data Streaming:** Capabilities for streaming large geospatial datasets or real-time sensor data efficiently over APIs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- FastAPI, Uvicorn (or similar ASGI server)
- GraphQL libraries (e.g., Strawberry, Ariadne)
- Relevant database connectors if API directly queries data stores.

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the GEO-INFER repository if you haven't already
# git clone https://github.com/activeinference/GEO-INFER.git
# cd GEO-INFER/GEO-INFER-API

pip install -e .
# or poetry install if pyproject.toml is configured
```

### Configuration
API server settings (host, port), security parameters (e.g., JWT secrets, OAuth provider details), database connections, and upstream service endpoints are configured in `config/` files or environment variables.
```bash
# cp config/example_api_server.yaml config/local_api_server.yaml
# # Edit local_api_server.yaml
```

### Running Tests
```bash
pytest tests/
```

### Starting the API server
(Typically using an ASGI server like Uvicorn for FastAPI applications)
```bash
# Example using Uvicorn for a FastAPI app defined in geo_infer_api.app:main_app
uvicorn geo_infer_api.app:main_app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

## API Standards Adherence

GEO-INFER-API strives to implement and promote the use of key industry and community standards:

-   **OGC API Suite:**
    -   `OGC API - Features`: For accessing vector feature data.
    -   `OGC API - Processes`: For executing geospatial processing tasks asynchronously.
    -   `OGC API - Maps` & `OGC API - Tiles`: For serving pre-rendered maps and map tiles.
    -   `OGC API - Environmental Data Retrieval (EDR)`: For accessing environmental data using spatio-temporal queries.
    -   `OGC SensorThings API`: For accessing observations and metadata from IoT sensors.
-   **SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) API:** For discovering and accessing collections of Earth observation data and other spatio-temporal assets.
-   **GeoJSON & GeoJSON-LD:** For representing geospatial features and linked data.
-   **OpenAPI Specification (OAS v3+):** For designing, documenting, and testing RESTful APIs.
-   **GraphQL Best Practices:** For schema design, query optimization, and pagination.

## Authentication & Authorization

The module provides a comprehensive security layer for all API interactions:

-   **API Key Authentication:** Simple token-based authentication for basic access.
-   **OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect (OIDC):** Robust, standard-based authorization framework for delegated access and integration with identity providers.
-   **JSON Web Tokens (JWT):** Used for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object, commonly for stateless authentication.
-   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Defining roles and permissions to control access to specific API endpoints or data resources based on user identity and group membership.
-   **Rate Limiting & Throttling:** Protecting backend services from abuse and ensuring fair usage by limiting the number of requests a client can make in a given time period.
-   **Input Validation:** Rigorous validation of all incoming API request parameters and payloads to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.
-   **HTTPS Enforcement:** All API traffic must be over HTTPS.

## API Documentation

Interactive and comprehensive API documentation is a priority:

-   **OpenAPI/Swagger UI:** Automatically generated interactive UI for RESTful APIs, typically available at a `/docs` or `/swagger` endpoint. Allows users to explore endpoints, view schemas, and test requests directly in the browser.
-   **ReDoc Interface:** Alternative, more static documentation format generated from OpenAPI specs, often available at a `/redoc` endpoint. Provides a clean, three-panel view of the API.
-   **GraphQL Playground/Explorer:** Interactive environments like GraphQL Playground or GraphiQL for exploring GraphQL schemas, writing queries, and viewing results, usually at `/graphql`.
-   **Dedicated Documentation Portal:** For more detailed guides, tutorials, authentication instructions, and SDK usage examples, often integrated with the main GEO-INFER-INTRA documentation system.

## Integration with Other Modules

GEO-INFER-API acts as the primary interface layer:

-   **GEO-INFER-OPS (Operations):** OPS may monitor API health, performance, and usage statistics. OPS might also manage the deployment and scaling of API gateway instances.
-   **GEO-INFER-DATA (Data Management):** API exposes data managed by DATA through standardized interfaces (e.g., OGC API Features for vector data, STAC for imagery).
-   **GEO-INFER-SEC (Security):** API implements the authentication and authorization policies defined and managed by SEC. It forwards security events to SEC for auditing.
-   **GEO-INFER-APP (Applications):** User-facing applications built with APP consume services exposed by API to fetch data, trigger analyses, and interact with backend functionalities.
-   **All Analytical Modules (SPACE, TIME, AI, ACT, SIM, AGENT, etc.):** The functionalities of these modules (e.g., running a spatial analysis, training a model, querying an agent's state) are often exposed via API, allowing them to be invoked programmatically or integrated into larger workflows.
-   **GEO-INFER-INTRA (Knowledge Management):** API specifications and documentation generated by API are managed and disseminated by INTRA.

## Client Libraries & SDKs

To facilitate easier integration, GEO-INFER-API aims to provide or support the development of:

-   **Python SDK:** A comprehensive Python library for interacting with all GEO-INFER APIs, simplifying request formation, authentication, and response parsing.
-   **JavaScript/TypeScript SDK:** For web frontend development and Node.js applications.
-   **R Package:** For data scientists and analysts working within the R environment.
-   **Command-Line Interface (CLI) Tools:** For scripting, automation, and quick interaction with API endpoints from the terminal.
-   **Cookbooks & Examples:** Extensive collections of code snippets and example applications demonstrating how to use the SDKs and APIs for common tasks.
