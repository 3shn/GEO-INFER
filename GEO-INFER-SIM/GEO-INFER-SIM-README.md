# GEO-INFER-SIM

## Overview
GEO-INFER-SIM provides simulation environments for hypothesis testing and policy evaluation within the GEO-INFER framework. This module enables the creation of digital twins and agent-based models to simulate complex geospatial processes and evaluate potential interventions.

## Key Features
- Digital twin technology for simulating urban or ecological scenarios
- Agent-based models for behavior prediction under various conditions
- Scenario analysis for policy planning and evaluation
- Integration with real-world data for calibration and validation
