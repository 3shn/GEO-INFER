# GEO-INFER-BAYES

## Overview
GEO-INFER-BAYES provides a comprehensive framework for Bayesian inference processes within the GEO-INFER ecosystem. This module implements probabilistic modeling, uncertainty quantification, and Bayesian computational methods specifically tailored for geospatial applications, enabling robust inference and decision-making under uncertainty.

## Key Features
- Hierarchical Bayesian models for spatial and spatio-temporal data
- Bayesian computational methods (MCMC, HMC, VI, SMC)
- Probabilistic programming interfaces to PyMC, Stan, and TensorFlow Probability
- Bayesian model comparison and selection
- Spatial priors and likelihood functions for geospatial applications

## Getting Started
1. Installation
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

2. Configuration
   ```bash
   cp config/example.yaml config/local.yaml
   # Edit local.yaml with your configuration
   ```

3. Running a Simple Bayesian Analysis
   ```python
   from geo_infer_bayes.models import SpatialGP
   from geo_infer_bayes.core import BayesianInference
   
   # Define spatial data and model
   model = SpatialGP(kernel='matern')
   
   # Perform Bayesian inference
   inference = BayesianInference(model=model, method='mcmc')
   results = inference.run(data=spatial_data)
   
   # Analyze and visualize posterior
   results.plot_posterior()
   ```

## Bayesian Modeling Capabilities
The module provides specialized modeling tools for:
- Gaussian Process regression for spatial interpolation
- Bayesian hierarchical models for multi-level spatial data
- Dirichlet process mixtures for spatial clustering
- Bayesian time series models with spatial components
- Bayesian networks for causal inference in spatial systems

## Computational Methods
Supported computational approaches include:
- Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) with specialized spatial proposals
- Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) for efficient sampling in high dimensions
- Variational Inference for scalable approximations
- Sequential Monte Carlo for online inference
- Approximate Bayesian Computation for complex likelihood functions

## Uncertainty Quantification
Tools for quantifying and visualizing uncertainty:
- Posterior predictive distributions
- Credible intervals and regions for spatial predictions
- Uncertainty propagation through computational pipelines
- Decision-theoretic frameworks for risk assessment
- Sensitivity analysis for model parameters
